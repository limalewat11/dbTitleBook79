<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Transformative Experience</h2><p>As we live our lives, we repeatedly make decisions that shape our future circumstances and affect the sort of person we will be. When choosing whether to start a family, or deciding on a career, we often think we can assess the options by imagining what different experiences would be like for us. L. A. Paul argues that, for choices involving dramatically new experiences, we are confronted by the brute fact that we can know very little about our subjective futures. This has serious implications for our decisions. If we make life choices in the way we naturally and intuitively want to--by considering what we care about, and what our future selves will be like if we choose to have the experience--we only learn what we really need to know after we have already committed ourselves. If we try to escape the dilemma by avoiding an experience, we have still made a choice. <br><br>Choosing rationally, then, may require us to regard big life decisions as choices to make discoveries, small and large, about the intrinsic nature of experience, and to recognize that part of the value of living authentically is to experience one's life and preferences in whatever way they may evolve in the wake of the choices one makes.<br><br>Using classic philosophical examples about the nature of consciousness, and drawing on recent work in normative decision theory, cognitive science, epistemology, and the philosophy of mind, Paul develops a rigorous account of transformative experience that sheds light on how we should understand real-world experience and our capacity to rationally map our subjective futures.<br></p><p><br><strong>L.

It was a grim scene that would, of course, be repeated endlessly throughout the war. Instead of running or giving in to despair, these brothers - Tuvia, Zus, and Asael Bielski - fought back, waging a guerrilla war of wits against the Nazis.</p> <p>By using their intimate knowledge of the dense forests surrounding the Belarusan towns of Novogrudek and Lida, the Bielskis evaded the Nazis and established a hidden base camp, then set about convincing other Jews to join their ranks. As more and more Jews arrived each day, a robust community began to emerge, a "Jerusalem in the woods."</p> <p>After two and a half years in the woods, in July 1944, the Bielskis learned that the Germans, overrun by the Red Army, were retreating back toward Berlin. More than one thousand Bielski Jews emerged - alive - on that final, triumphant exit from the woods.</p></p><p><p>Peter Duffy is the author of <em>The Bielski Brothers</em>.

Here, he examines the ways in which developments in the courts and commercial centers of the Americas, Europe, and Africa have affected the common people, who have tried since the nineteenth century to take control of their political, social and economic lives. Pic� expands his landmark 1986 book, Historia General, for this first updated American edition to include movements and events as recent as the fight for Vieques. This English edition has been updated and translated by the author.</p><p>Fernando Pico , University of Puerto Rico is author of several books including &#34;Puerto Rico 1898: the War after the War&#34;"An intelligent and up-to-date work." -- <i>Annales</i><br><br>"Superbly synthesized" -- <i>Hispanic American Historical Review</i><br><br>" Essentially, this is an updated and expanded version of the second edition of the brilliant work published in Spanish in 1986...Like all excellent histories of the Caribbean, this one is inordinately rich on the social aspects of community formation and the inevitable cross-imperial relations that invariably frustrated local administrators -- <i>Choice Magazine</i><br><br>"An intelligent and up-to-date work."- -- <i>Annales</i><br><br>"Superbly synthesized" -- <i>Hispanic American Historical Review</i><br><br>HISPAPANIC AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW vol 88.no. 4 2008 "Since 1986 students of Puerto Rican history have benefited from several editions of Fer-nando Pico's Historia general de Puerto Rico, which now appears in a welcome English version, updated and translated by the author. Simultaneously, Ediciones Huracan in San Juan has released a new Spanish edition under the original title. Pico is a leading historian of the island, having worked with primary sources and published on various topics and time periods; his knowledge of Puerto Rican historiography is broad and deep. The book is especially recommended for the general public and for use as a core text in undergraduate surveys of Puerto Rican history. As the subtitle in English implies, the Puerto Rican people, in all their diversity, are placed at the center of Pico's analysis, and he argues that the processes they initiated "are more important than the decisions made by the ruling figures of the North Atlantic" (p. xi), at least in the long term. While Pico gives consistent attention to the initiatives and impacts of nonelites, it is clear that at times these were swamped -- though never anni-hilated--by those of foreign capital and governments. A second goal is to "address the claims made by" four currents of Puerto Rican historiography--great men/moralistic, institutional, and social/economic studies, and studies of "historians' own ambivalent practices" (p. viii)--which Pico accomplishes implicitly for the most part, even in the footnotes. Pico is unfailingly polite and jargon-free even when openly disputative. He chides the Taino roots movement gently for contributing to the marginalization of Afri-can heritage in Puerto Rico, courteously demolishes the notion that either the Bourbons or municipal authorities had much control on the ground in the eighteenth century, and casts doubt on the argument that a separate Creole bourgeoisie took clear form by the end of the iSoos. The most impassioned section of the book is the final few pages, which constitute a moving call to celebrate Puerto Rican diversity, achievements, and commit-ment to education and social justice. The narrative achieves a very readable synthesis of much of the progress in Puerto Rican historiography as a whole, incorporating political, diplomatic, and military his�tory with social, economic, and to some extent cultural history, and beginning with a brief chapter sketching the geological zones and ecosystems of the island. The select bibliography lists several dozen secondary sources published since the first Spanish edi�tion of 1986, and a brief hunt through the notes, particularly for the last two chapters on recent history, reveals more. Pico often begins chapters by placing Puerto Rico in relevant broader contexts such as the early modern Atlantic World or the expanding United States hemispheric hegemony in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Organized chronologically, the book offers a quite even coverage of the four main periods (1510-17605, 17605-18205, 18205-18905, since 1898), --Hispanic American Historical Review</p><h2>The Cartel 3: The Last Chapter</h2><p>The Cartel has come full circle with this fast-paced, groundbreaking novel, the finale to the hit series by New York Times bestsellers Ashley &amp; JaQuavis.

With no geographical raison d&#39;�tre and no obvious political roots in its Roman, Germanic, or Islamic pasts, it for long remained a small, struggling realm on Europe&#39;s outer fringe. Then, in the early fifteenth century, this unlikely springboard for Western expansion suddenly began to accumulate an empire of its own, eventually extending more than halfway around the globe. The History of Portugal and the Portuguese Empire, drawing particularly on historical scholarship postdating the 1974 Portuguese Revolution, offers readers a comprehensive overview and reinterpretation of how all this happened - the first such account to appear in English for more than a generation.

Blunt and unsparing, it is a first-hand account of murder, money, and corruption told by wiseguy-turned-witness Nick Caramandi, whose testimony put Nicky Scarfo and many of his associates behind bars for the rest of their lives. A prime target for hit men to this day, Caramandi continues to survive only through the government&#39;s Witness Protection Program. In this updated edition of Blood and Honor, author George Anastasia picks up the story where he left off, filling us in on the fates of all the characters--major and minor--in recent years.</p><p>GEORGE ANASTASIA, a veteran reporter for the Philadelphia Inquirer, is the author of four books of nonfiction, including three about the Philadelphia mob. He has won many awards for investigative journalism and magazine writing.Up-close and personal perspectives on a consequential Mafia family that law-enforcement agencies and turncoats have all but put out of business. Drawing mainly on interviews with Nick Caramandi (a confessed killer, loan shark, and extortionist now in the Federal Witness Protection Program), Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Anastasia offers a tellingly detailed rundown on a fiefdom encompassing not only his hometown but also Atlantic City from the late 1970's through the mid-1980's. During this violent period, an arguably psychopathic thug named Nicodemo Scarfo headed the local branch of La Cosa Nostra. His regime was notable for unusually savage rub- outs as well as for the systematic corruption of public and union officials. Eventually, however, the deadly don and more than a dozen of his henchmen were convicted on scores of felony murder and RICO charges in a series of trials that began in 1987. Among those responsible for putting Scarfo behind bars was Garamandi, a successful streetwise hustler who had been formally initiated into the mob. The erstwhile wiseguy broke the secret society's vow of silence and became an informer when he learned his capo had marked him for death in the wake of a failed real-estate swindle involving Philadelphia pols. The decision to eliminate Caramandi ranks among the vengeful Scarfo's worst since ``Crow'' (as he's known in gangland circles) provided government prosecutors with the firsthand dope they needed to bring a flock of kingpin outlaws to book. The gossipy stool pigeon here also provides the author an insider's savvy briefing on the quotidian world of organized crime; by Garamandi's credible account, there was appreciably more bad blood than honor among the thieves in thrall to Scarfo.

He lives in Colorado Springs, Colorado.<br></p>It&#x2019;s hard to say when it all went to hell.<p></p><p>The mug shots of Jack Byrnes and Dick Legg taken at the beginning of their last military assignments betray no hint of the elemental forces that would soon engulf them. Missing from the muddy black&#x2013;and&#x2013;white photographs is evidence of the reckless passions and base instincts of two saboteurs&#x2014;or, conversely, the bewildered innocence of a couple of patsies&#x2014; that would make them the main players in one of the most mysterious human dramas in industrial history. Sure, if you search their faces for telltale signs of character, you might glimpse something intense and smoldering in the deep&#x2013;set eyes of Jack Byrnes; you might detect a slight, smug smile on the squarish face of Dick Legg. But that&#x2019;s just mental rubbernecking. It&#x2019;s been more than four decades since the photographs were snapped, and they don&#x2019;t offer up much besides a musty smell and a record of bad haircuts. There&#x2019;s no indication the two weren&#x2019;t destined for long lives and ordinary deaths.</p><p>The passage of years and the death and silence of friends and family have left but the bleached bones of the two men&#x2019;s histories. They left no diaries, no record of notable achievements, and few anecdotes to hint at the mix of characteristics that made up their personalities. When they arrived in 1959 in Idaho&#x2019;s fertile Snake River Valley to take up what would be their final posts, Byrnes and Legg were still unformed, still works&#x2013;in&#x2013;progress, their individual potentials and futures as fuzzy as their service photographs. They were typical American boys on the cusp of manhood, at that age when character, talent, and limitations are just beginning to emerge. Born in the late 1930s in quiet American towns, the two played soldiers while real ones marched across Europe in World War II. As teens, they saw a great explosion in American power as those soldiers came home and rebuilt their country on the GI Bill, a package of government benefits that allowed soldiers to buy houses and attend college. Byrnes and Legg were young men of their time, schooled in the buoyant hopes of prosperity and order, confident that progress would give them better lives than their fathers, agitated by the sense of change and possibility that was sweeping America at the cusp of the 1960s.</p><p>The new god that emerged after World War II&#x2014;the tripartite deity of industry, science, and technology&#x2014;promised to make all these things possible, even for those of modest means and education. It was the atomic age, when Americans decided they had the knowledge, right, and wisdom to harness for other uses the terrible power released upon Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The atom had ended the war, smote the enemy. But surely its power could be tamed, used to power boats and planes, deliver unlimited electricity, revolutionize medicine. Atomic energy, America&#x2019;s leaders promised, would checkmate America&#x2019;s enemies while it bestowed on all others the gift of limitless energy. It was a seductive idea&#x2014;using nondescript uranium ore to transform the world.</p><p>By the time Jack Byrnes and Dick Legg peered at the lens of a military camera, they had bought into this atomic&#x2013;powered version of the American Dream. They were determined young men in a hurry, hungry for the good things in life, cocksure about their abilities and opportunities. For them and thousands of others, there was no better place to find the new America than at the National Reactor Testing Station, located on the vast expanse of sagebrush in Idaho&#x2019;s Lost River Desert. Established in 1949, the classified site lay just west of the Snake River Valley and was a monument to the golden age of nuclear science. It was a place where American men fearlessly played with the atom. When Byrnes and Legg arrived, almost two dozen nuclear reactors dotted the desert floor, prototypes of machines that would revolutionize propulsion and energy&#x2014;and life. Government&#x2013;issued films of the time celebrated the &#x201c;new hope of the atomic era&#x201d; and hinted at the blessings it would afford. Standing before models of prosperous and gleaming cities, film narrators&#x2014;invariably white men in crew cuts and black suits&#x2014;championed the glorious changes nuclear power would introduce to the arts, humanities, and sciences. An article in a 1958 issue of <i>National Geographic</i> concludes that &#x201c;abundant energy released from the hearts of atoms promises a vastly different and better tomorrow for all mankind.&#x201d;</p><p>There were a few people who had doubts about the message. Ranchers and sheepherders in the American West were starting to voice concern about radioactive fallout from the nuclear weapons testing then being conducted in the Nevada desert, fallout that had made its way north to the Lost River Desert. Some experts and interest groups were raising questions about storing radioactive materials and locating nuclear plants near large cities. There were even some who scoffed at the rosy nuclear future portrayed in publications and documentaries at the time. But generally, the American people&#x2014; and the folks in Idaho&#x2014;believed the benefits of atomic energy outweighed the dangers it posed. For Byrnes and Legg, the lure of the atom had little to do with the promises and peril it posed to mankind. For them, it meant a paycheck and it meant a brighter personal future. They joined a select group of young engineers, construction workers, soldiers, and scientists flooding the wilds of Idaho to turn nuclear dreams into reality.</p><p>Then carne January 3, 1961, a day that foreshadowed the dimming of the atomic dream, even if it remains a curiously obscure date to all but a few nuclear insiders. That afternoon, Byrnes arrived at a small experimental army nuclear reactor for his shift with Legg and a trainee, Richard McKinley. The three were scheduled to perform routine maintenance work. Nothing suggested that it would be anything other than an ordinary night.</p><p>But just a few short hours later, the ordinary became extraordinary. The events that unfolded in the crude silo of Stationary Low&#x2013;Power Unit 1 on that January night would spawn more than four decades of scandalous rumors and speculation in the closed world of the nuclear industry. That one cataclysmic night would underscore the fragile line between the fallibility of man and the complexity of an intricate science. It would also reveal, but only much later, how a government shaped by a pervasive Cold War mentality would protect the then&#x2013;fledging nuclear industry from public scrutiny.</p><p>While there were markers on the road leading to the chaos and calamity of that night&#x2014;men with increasingly tumultuous personal affairs and a reactor with malfunctioning equipment&#x2014;it was impossible to predict how these elements would collide in such a mysterious, unprecedented manner. Despite a nuclear testing facility that housed highly sensitive, top&#x2013;secret equipment and some of the brightest minds of that generation, there was no way to measure, test, or imagine what would happen in the frigid southeastern Idaho desert on that January night. There was no way to predict the disaster.</p><p></p></p><h2>Men Who Love Fierce Women: The Power of Servant Leadership in Your Marriage</h2><p><p><b><i>&#x201c;</i></b><i>Five years into &#x2018;wedded bliss,&#x2019; I confessed to Kim that I no longer loved her.

This updated Satanic Bible marks a reformation in the religion of Satanism, accessible to the average reader and philosopher alike. Satanists who struggled to find meaning in LaVey's Rand-inspired social Darwinism, will embrace this new focus on activism and social justice. While the skepticism and secular ethics mirror that of Humanism, this Satanic philosophy goes much further: incorporating rebellion, unrelenting perseverance, being the outcast, the individualist, and the adversary. The characteristics of each aspect of the Satan archetype are meticulously explained and linked to the philosophy presented. This not only justifies why it is worthy of the name &#x201c;Satanism&#x201d;, but also answers the question of why it can only be called &#x201c;Satanism&#x201d;.</p><p>This is a short book of just seven thousand words. It's very concise, and a similar length to the actual philosophical portion of The Satanic Bible. This is what you need to understand and practice this variation of Satanism. It's a foundational text, introducing the subject, and presenting just the information needed for its stated purpose.<br><br>A much larger, comprehensive, advanced Satanic philosophy book will be written next. That one will be more for study and in-depth understanding, whereas the current book is more of a quick practical guide.Damien Ba al is a Unix/Linux engineer by day and a philosopher by night.

Active on social media, Damien s words convey his dark presence to all the outcasts and individualists traveling the Left-Hand Path.</p><h2>Jesus Never Existed: An Introduction to the Ultimate Heresy</h2><p>Even among modern atheists, a fragile consensus holds that Jesus was at least a real person, whose historical presence, though embellished, has been reliably established in the order of disinterested scholarship. Whether he is envisioned as peace-loving rabbinical sage or as a militant prophet of doom, this man called Jesus is widely assumed to have had an important, even a profound, impact on the course of world history.<br><br> But in the early years of the 21st century a radical &#x2013; though not particularly new &#x2013; thesis has become increasingly difficult to ignore. This thesis, as it is argued over and disseminated across the Internet and made accessible in a rapidly growing number of books, threatens to displace the regnant historiographical paradigm with a simple but devastating proposition: that Jesus never existed at all!<br><br> In the space of this hard-hitting monograph and supplemental interview, dissident scholar Kenneth Humphreys interrogates the biblical and historical evidence to offer this concise and pithy exposition of a &#x201c;fringe&#x201d; idea whose time has come. Not content to merely poke holes in tall tales from antiquity, Humphreys presents a surprisingly straightforward case that Jesus, thought by millions of naive believers to have been God incarnate, or at least the Son of God, was not even a man.<br><br> Until now, most scholars of religion have, at least publicly, been content to repeat the safe and conciliatory assurance that a Jesus &#x201c;probably&#x201d; existed. But we may well be approaching a tipping point when those same scholars, confronted with powerful evidence and an inquisitive public, will summon the courage to aver that Jesus &#x201c;probably&#x201d; never existed after all.<br><br> Having devoted much of his life to the careful study of ancient history, Humphreys harbors no doubt: Jesus, the non-existent son of a non-existent father, will soon be consigned to a place among his ancestors&#x2013;Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Moses&#x2013;in the realm of mythology, not history.<br><br> Let this be your introduction to the ultimate heresy!</p><p></p><h2>Superman: The Golden Age Vol. 1</h2><p>Historic first appearances from Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster&#x2019;s legendary Man of Steel!<br><br> Faster than a speeding bullet, Superman burst onto the comic book scene in 1938, just as America was on the terrifying precipice of a world war.

He swiftly became a symbol of hope for a downtrodden America.<br><br> Collecting all of the Metropolis Wonder&#x2019;s first-ever adventures from ACTION COMICS #1-19, SUPERMAN #1-3 and NEW YORK WORLD&#x2019;S FAIR COMICS #1!</p><p>Born in 1914 in Cleveland, OH, Jerome Siegel was, as a teenager, a fan of the emerging literary genre that came to be known as science fiction. Together with schoolmate Joe Shuster, Siegel published several science fiction fan magazines, and in 1933 they came up with their own science fiction hero--Superman. Siegel scripted and Shuster drew several weeks' worth of newspaper strips featuring their new creation, but garnered no interest from publishers or newspaper syndicates. It wasn't until the two established themselves as reliable adventure-strip creators at DC Comics that the editors at DC offered to take a chance on the Superman material--provided it was re-pasted into comic book format for DC's new magazine, <i>Action Comics</i>.<br><br>Siegel wrote the <i>Adventures of Superman</i> (as well as other DC heroes, most notably the Spectre, his co-creation with Bernard Baily) through 1948 and then again from 1959-1966, in the interim scripting several newspaper strips including Funnyman and Ken Winston. Jerry Siegel died in January, 1996.</p><h2>Blood and Bone: A Novel of the Malazan Empire (Novels of the Malazan Empire, 5)</h2><p><p>In the western sky the bright emerald banner of the Visitor descends like a portent of annihilation.

Divinity is indicated with a faint halo, but Frazee never sacrifices the ineffable humanity of each depiction; her Gods are fat, skinny, joyful, contemplative, worn-out.... Funny, devout and oh, so human; this collection hits home.&#x201d; Source: Kirkus Reviews, April 10, 2013, *STARRED REVIEW<br><br>"Sixteen poems from Rylant&#x2019;s <i>God Went to Beauty School</i> (2003) return in a new collection, accompanied by new artwork from Frazee, whose graphite-and-gouache illustrations are ideally attuned to the poems&#x2019; moments of irreverent humor and poignant reflection. In several images, Frazee portrays God as a child.... Rylant and Frazee&#x2019;s visions of God as a trucker delivering a fan letter to a country music singer, an ostensibly homeless woman walking through a gorgeous gothic church, and a dadlike fellow in plaid pajamas and slippers sipping coffee under an apple tree combine to form a celebration of God&#x2019;s humanity and mankind&#x2019;s divinity." Source: Publishers Weekly, August 2013<br><br><b>* </b>"An award-winning author and illustrator team up to create a lyrical celebration of where the divine meets the mundane, and ultimately what it means to be human. In this small book of poetry, God decides to &#x201c;try out&#x201d; different activities and experiences of humanity, and the results are by turns thought-provoking and inspiring. Each of the 15 poems is coupled with a quietly incandescent illustration that supports the text but doesn&#x2019;t overwhelm it or diminish its impact. Taken from the author&#x2019;s longer collection God Went to Beauty School (HarperCollins, 2003), this slimmed down, repackaged version brilliantly captures its sweetness and substance but provides a simpler progression and arc. Selections alternate pronouns for the deity, with God referred to as He or She in each poem.... While this title might be controversial...it will appeal to a wide audience of both children and adults. This is one book that&#x2019;s easy to pick up, but hard to put down again." Source: School Library Journal, November 2013, *STARRED REVIEW<br><br><b>* </b>"Oh, God. As this book so intriguingly suggests, You do come in many shapes and sizes. Colors, too. But more than what the deity looks like, this slim volume of 15 poems focuses on what God does.... The messages aren&#x2019;t always immediately clear, but that&#x2019;s what makes this so much fun. Seeing God in new ways allows children to think about their relationship to Him or Her differently. In this interpretation, God and humans are co-creators of an evolving world. Though the poetry has been published before in a collection, the artwork is all new. Frazee&#x2019;s pictures, each facing a page of text, are a powerful contrast of light and darkness, restlessness and contentment. God didn&#x2019;t think she had time for a dog. But she got one anyway."

For those of you who may be new to the site, the last few months have been a bit of a bumpy ride since both my husband and my former employer simultaneously sent me packing in hopes of landing a younger model.<br> <br>My soon-to-be-ex, aka Fang, as he&#x2019;s known in the blogosphere, called me yesterday. It was the first time I&#x2019;d heard from him directly in several months. What surprised me more than anything was how much I DIDN&#x2019;T feel when I heard his voice. That, I believe, is a good sign. It turns out Fang was calling, in his own imperious way, to make sure I&#x2019;d be in court tomorrow so the divorce decree can be finalized. I could have given him grief about it. Could have claimed I was sick or maimed or just too annoyed to bother driving eight hours plus from Sedona over to L.A. And, had I done so, it would have sent him up a wall. You see, Fang needs this divorce right about now a whole lot more than I do. Our court appearance is scheduled Friday. Saturday is Fang&#x2019;s wedding day.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve heard rumors that he and his blushing bride, aka Twink, are planning a big-deal celebration, a catered affair with all the right people in attendance at what used to be our joint domicile on Robert Lane. In view of the fact that Twink is expecting Fang&#x2019;s baby within weeks of the scheduled nuptials, you might think a little more discretion was called for, but discretion has never been Fang&#x2019;s long suit. For that matter, it must not be Twink&#x2019;s, either, since the baby was conceived some time prior to my abandoning our marriage bed.<br> <br>For those of you who are concerned about my state of mind as I approach this change in marital status, don&#x2019;t be. I&#x2019;m fine. I&#x2019;m ready to make a clean break of it; glad to have what was clearly my sham of a marriage&#x2014;as far as Fang was concerned anyway&#x2014;over and done with. I&#x2019;m moving on with my new life. When you&#x2019;re doing that, hanging on to the old one doesn&#x2019;t help. Neither does bitterness. As my mother is prone to point out, bitterness destroys the container it&#x2019;s in.<br> <br>If I do say so myself, this particular container is going to be in pretty fine shape tomorrow when I show up in court. With my son&#x2019;s help, I&#x2019;ve been working out. My personal shopper at Nordstrom&#x2019;s down in Scottsdale has set aside a couple of new outfits for me. I plan on picking up one of them on my way through Phoenix later on this afternoon.<br> <br>In other words, for today anyway, I&#x2019;m a rolling stone, and rolling stones gather no moss&#x2014;and do no blogging.<br> <br>Posted 7:23 A.M., September 15, 2005 by Babe<br><br>As soon as Ali Reynolds hauled her suitcase out of the closet, Samantha, Ali&#x2019;s now permanent refugee cat, disappeared. Completely. Ali found it hard to believe that a sixteen-pound, one-eared cat could pull off that kind of magicianship, but she could.<br> <br>Six months earlier, a series of forced moves had left Sam in a new, unfamiliar home with a new owner who wasn&#x2019;t exactly enamored of cats. Over time, Ali and Sam had developed a grudging respect for each other. With the unwelcome appearance of a suitcase, however, all bets were off. For Sam, the sight of a suitcase and/or the dreaded cat crate brought back all those bad old times and sent the panicky kitty scrambling for someplace to hide.<br> <br>It took Ali a good two hours&#x2014;two hours she didn&#x2019;t have&#x2014;to find the animal again, scrunched in beside the drainpipe behind the washing machine in the laundry room. And finding Sam was only part of the problem. Extricating the cat from her snug little hidey-hole and into the cat crate for a trip to Ali&#x2019;s parents&#x2019; place was a whole other issue. Had it been any other weekend, Sam could have remained at home and been looked after by Ali&#x2019;s son, Christopher, but it happened that Chris was due at a two-day seminar in Phoenix starting early Saturday morning.<br> <br>&#x201c;Off to Grandma&#x2019;s with you,&#x201d; Ali said, retrieving the indignant cat and stuffing her into the waiting crate. &#x201c;And you&#x2019;d better behave yourself, too.&#x201d;<br> <br>And so, hours later than she had intended, Ali finally finished packing. With Sam yowling in bitter protest, Ali left her hilltop mobile-home digs and drove her lapis blue Porsche Cayenne down to the highway, where she parked under the shady weeping willow tree outside her parents&#x2019; family-owned diner, Sedona&#x2019;s fabled Sugar Loaf Caf�.<br> <br>Inside, the lunch hour rush was just beginning. Edie Larson, Ali&#x2019;s mother, was working the cash register and lunch counter while Ali&#x2019;s father, Bob, held sway in the kitchen. Edie picked up an empty coffeepot and headed for the back counter to refill it, glancing reflexively at her watch as she did so.<br> <br>&#x201c;You call this an early start?&#x201d; Edie asked.<br> <br>Since Edie rose every morning at o-dark-thirty to prepare the Sugar Loaf&#x2019;s daily supply of signature sweet rolls, she considered any departure that happened after 6 A.M. to be tardy. She had thought Ali&#x2019;s initial estimated departure of nine to be close to slothful. Now it was coming up on noon.<br> <br>&#x201c;Unfortunately, Sam had other ideas,&#x201d; Ali said. &#x201c;She saw the suitcase and went into hiding. I found her, though, finally.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; Edie said reassuringly. &#x201c;Cats usually don&#x2019;t like change, but by the time your father gets finished spoiling Sam, that ugly cat of yours won&#x2019;t even want to go back home. Where is she, by the way?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Out in the car in the shade.&#x201d;<br> <br>Edie poured Ali a cup of coffee. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call Kip to come get the crate and take Sam back to the house.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kip Hogan was a formerly homeless Vietnam War vet Bob Larson had dragged home about the same time his daughter had adopted Sam. Originally Kip had been hired to help look after Bob in the aftermath of an unfortunate snowboarding accident that had left Ali&#x2019;s father temporarily wheelchair-bound. Bob had since recovered and was back at work, but Kip continued to hang around, living in an old Lazy Daze motor home parked in the Larsons&#x2019; backyard, helping out with odd jobs around both the house and the restaurant, and gradually becoming more and more indispensable.<br> <br>&#x201c;Want some lunch before you go?&#x201d; Edie asked. &#x201c;Or should I have Dad make up one of the coolers for you to take along with you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What would go in the cooler?&#x201d; Ali asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fried chicken,&#x201d; Bob Larson answered from the kitchen service window. &#x201c;Biscuits. Some homemade applesauce.&#x201d;<br> <br>Having been raised on her father&#x2019;s crisp fried chicken and her mother&#x2019;s lighter-than-air biscuits, there was really no contest. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have coffee now and take the cooler option,&#x201d; Ali answered.<br> <br>Edie took a brief jaunt down the counter, delivering coffee as she went, then she returned to Ali. &#x201c;Are you all right?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m perfectly fine,&#x201d; Ali said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be good to have this whole mess behind me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Edie agreed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure it will be.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ali had retreated to Sedona, her hometown, to find her bearings in the initial aftermath of both losing her job and learning about her husband&#x2019;s infidelity. She hadn&#x2019;t expected to like it; hadn&#x2019;t expected to be comfortable there, but she was. The double-wide mobile home her aunt Evelyn had left her may have seemed like a big comedown from the gated mansion on Robert Lane, but it suited Ali&#x2019;s needs, everything from the Jacuzzi soaking tub to the basement wine cellar. And having her son, Chris, for a roommate didn&#x2019;t hurt, either.<br> <br>Chris had graduated from UCLA and was in his first year of teaching welding and American history at Sedona High School. Ali enjoyed her son&#x2019;s company. He never left a mess in the kitchen, didn&#x2019;t stay out all that late, and spent much of his spare time working on his metal sculpting projects down in the basement. From what Ali could tell, she and Chris got along better than did many parents and their newly adult children.<br> <br>All in all, she felt at ease being back home in Sedona&#x2014;at ease and at peace.<br> <br>&#x201c;I wish Chris were going over with you,&#x201d; Edie added, seeming to read Ali&#x2019;s mind. &#x201c;Driving to L.A. is a long trip to do all by yourself.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Chris is busy with a seminar this weekend,&#x201d; Ali replied. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mind driving. In fact, I enjoy being on the open road. Besides, I&#x2019;ve got Aunt Evelyn&#x2019;s library of musicals along to keep me company.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, be sure you take plenty of breaks,&#x201d; Edie cautioned. &#x201c;They say tired drivers are as bad as drunk drivers.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bob rang the bell, letting Edie know that an order was ready. While she went away to deliver it, Kip Hogan turned up at Ali&#x2019;s elbow. &#x201c;Keys?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>When Kip had first appeared, six months earlier, he had come from a snowy, outdoor homeless encampment up on the Mogollan Rim. After years of living rough, he had been gaunt and grubby, with long, filthy hair, dirty clothes, missing teeth, and a much-broken nose. Kip&#x2019;s missing teeth and crooked nose were still at issue, but months of eating decent food had allowed him to fill out some. And dressed in respectable if secondhand clothing and with ready access to running water, the man looked far less scary than he had initially.<br> <br>Without a word, Ali handed over her car keys.<br> <br>&#x201c;Leave the cat in her crate in the living room,&#x201d; Edie told Kip as he started for the door. &#x201c;That way she&#x2019;ll have a chance to get used to her new digs before we let her out to explore.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; Kip replied. &#x201c;Will do.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;When will you be back?&#x201d; Edie asked her daughter.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tuesday or Wednesday,&#x201d; Ali replied. &#x201c;The divorce hearing is tomorrow. Then on Monday or Tuesday there&#x2019;s supposed to be a deposition in the wrongful dismissal suit. It didn&#x2019;t make sense to do two trips when one would work. So I&#x2019;ll stay over however long it takes to give the deposition.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; Edie agreed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s always better to kill two birds with one stone. More coffee?&#x201d;<br> <br>Ali let her mother refill her cup. Initially she had blamed her tardy departure on Sam. Now Ali realized that she was stalling even more all on her own&#x2014;and she knew why. Months after the fact, there was part of her that dreaded getting on I-17 and heading down to Phoenix. Ali Reynolds had almost died on one particularly dangerous stretch of that freeway when someone had tried to push her off the highway and over the edge of a sheer cliff. Being the target of an attempted murder is something that lingers, and even though Ali had driven that same route several times between then and now, she was still skittish. Just thinking about driving past the Sunset Point rest area and heading down the steep grade into the valley was enough to make Ali&#x2019;s hands go clammy.<br> <br>Her face must have betrayed some of the concern she was feeling.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you sure you wouldn&#x2019;t like some company?&#x201d; Edie Larson asked solicitously. &#x201c;And some moral support once you get there and have to go to court? I&#x2019;m sure your father could manage without me for a day or two. He wouldn&#x2019;t like it, but having to get up early enough to make the rolls wouldn&#x2019;t kill him.&#x201d;<br> <br>Touched by the offer, Ali smiled. &#x201c;Thanks, Mom,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be fine. Really.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And you&#x2019;ll call and let us know how it&#x2019;s going?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I promise.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kip returned with her car keys, and Ali took her leave. She stopped by the bank and picked up some cash. She had a particular pet charity that she wanted to help along while she was in L.A., and she knew a cash gift would be most welcome.<br> <br>A little less than an hour after leaving the bank, Ali was past the most worrisome stretch of the Black Canyon Freeway and headed into Scottsdale. At the time she had left her evening news gig in L.A., she had ditched her old newscasting wardrobe and her California persona like a snake shedding a cast-off skin. For as long as she&#x2019;d been in Sedona, she&#x2019;d worn her hair in a less than stylish ponytail and limited her wardrobe to what was comfortable&#x2014;mostly sweatshirts and worn jeans. Now, though, facing courtroom appointments and the prospect of more than a little public notoriety, Ali understood that she needed to dress and look the part. Not only did she pick up several outfits, she stopped into one of Scottsdale&#x2019;s upscale salons for some much needed pampering, including a haircut along with a spa-style mani/pedi.<br> <br>Properly attired, coiffed, and accessorized, Ali felt ready to face what she had come to think of as her California ordeal. She headed west in late-afternoon, rush-hour traffic and soon found herself stuck in a jam of speeding eighteen-wheelers, all of them driving blindly but hell-bent-for-election into the setting sun. Tired of trying to stay out of their way, Ali pulled off at the first rest area she saw. There, sitting at a shaded picnic table, she opened her cooler. Not only was her father&#x2019;s carefully prepared food there, so was a collection of plastic utensils. With noisy traffic rushing by in the background, Ali savored her combination lunch/dinner of fried chicken and honey-slathered biscuits. Then, feeling fatigued and still not wanting to face into the blazing sunset, she returned to the Cayenne, locked the doors, lowered her seat back, and allowed herself the luxury of a nap.<br> <br>She slept far longer than she expected. It was dark when she woke up, but she felt refreshed. Once back on the road, Ali was relieved to realize that traffic was noticeably lighter, and she was grateful she&#x2019;d had the good sense to wait out the setting sun rather than driving into it.<br> <br>Ali realized that that was one of the wonderful things about traveling on her own. She could eat when she was hungry, sleep when she was tired. It wasn&#x2019;t necessary to take anyone else&#x2019;s needs, wants, or opinions into consideration. Yes, being back on her own was definitely growing on Ali Reynolds.<br> <br>She took her mother&#x2019;s advice to heart. When she stopped for gas in Blythe, she stopped at a roadside restaurant for coffee as well. She was halfway through the second cup when her phone rang.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Helga Myerhoff said in her distinctly gruff and smoky voice. &#x201c;Have we girded our loins?&#x201d;<br> <br>Helga, sometimes called Rottweiler Myerhoff, had a not-undeserved reputation for being one of the Hollywood elite&#x2019;s premier divorce attorneys. With Helga&#x2019;s help and with the added impetus of Paul wanting a fast divorce as opposed to a cheap one, Ali had a generous divorce settlement coming to her, one that gave her pretty much everything she wanted. Between them Helga and Ali had, in fact, taken Fang to the cleaners.<br> <br>Ali laughed. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re girded, all right. New duds, new haircut, killer nails. Believe me, I&#x2019;m ready.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; Helga said. &#x201c;And you&#x2019;re staying at the Westwood on Wilshire?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; Ali answered. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m booked there through Tuesday. Marcella has a wrongful dismissal deposition coming up on either Monday or Tuesday. I&#x2019;m staying over for that as well.&#x201d;<br> <br>Marcella Johnson and Helga both worked for the same high-end legal firm, Weldon, Davis, and Reed, but the two women had wildly divergent styles and areas of expertise. Helga specialized in divorce cases. Marcella focused on employment issues. Ali counted herself fortunate to have not one but two dynamic attorneys on her team.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about tomorrow,&#x201d; Helga said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re in good shape on this and I&#x2019;m pretty sure it&#x2019;ll go through without a hitch. Still, though, until everything&#x2019;s signed, sealed, and delivered, our agreement in principle could conceivably go south.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Paul won&#x2019;t let that happen,&#x201d; Ali said with a laugh. &#x201c;Not with his shotgun wedding set for Saturday. If something goes wrong with his walking April Gaddis down the aisle, there&#x2019;ll be hell to pay.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re all right then?&#x201d; Helga aske...</p><h2>Broken Glass (2) (The Mirror Sisters Series)</h2><p>This second gothic novel in the dark Mirror Sisters trilogy continues the tale of sisterly love at its absolute worst&#x2014;from the legendary <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Flowers in the Attic</i> and <i>My Sweet Audrina</i> (now Lifetime movies).

What he finds there--in his handsome, solitary landlord; in the city's somber mood and sepulchral architecture; and in the strange and impassioned journals of Mary Todd Lincoln--shows him unexpected truths about America and loss.</p><p>Andrew Holleran is the author of three novels, <em>Dancer from the Dance</em> (a <em>NYT</em> notable book), <em>Nights in Aruba</em>, and <em>The Beauty of Men</em>. He has also written a book of essays, <em>Ground Zero</em>, and a book of short stories, <em>In September the Light Changes</em>. He lives in Washington, D.C."The beautiful life was brief."<p> These words, from Constantine Cavafy's poem "In the Evening," could serve as an epigraph for the body of work produced over the last 28 years by Andrew Holleran. Holleran's 1978 debut novel, Dancer from the Dance , was hailed for its groundbreaking and unapologetic account of gay life in the post-Stonewall era. Its themes and swooping prose owed much to Proust and F. Scott Fitzgerald, especially The Great Gatsby. When one rereads it now, nearly three decades later, the novel seems eerily prescient of the devastating effect the AIDS epidemic had upon the gay community (and continues to have throughout the world).</p><p> But in its wake, a generation of gay men came to build their own glittering clubs and mansions and memories upon a landscape that for many years resembled a war zone. Most of Holleran's later writings -- two novels, a story collection, the searing essays in Ground Zero, one of the best dispatches from the epidemic's height -- have dealt with these survivors.</p><p> Grief, his haunting and unexpectedly exhilarating new novel, takes his longtime themes -- loss, desire, the deep joy and solace humans derive from their homes and surroundings -- and distills them into a heady, bittersweet aperitif. And like the best aperitifs, this slender novel whets one's appetite for an entire meal of the author's other work.</p><p> The unnamed narrator has arrived in Washington, D.C., to teach a university seminar on Literature and AIDS. In addition to the systemic sense of loss shared by many gay men of his generation, he feels a nearly insuperable burden of guilt over his mother's death, compounded because he never came out to her. He rents a room near Dupont Circle, in a townhouse he shares with his landlord, another middle-aged gay man. The two pass each other on the stairs and sometimes in the kitchen. Occasionally, these fleeting encounters extend into conversations but nothing more intimate. In his free time, the narrator walks around the city or reads a book he has found in his bedroom: "Mary Todd Lincoln: Her Life and Letters."</p><p> That's pretty much it for plot.</p><p> Yet, as with the fiction of James Salter -- the writer Holleran's prose most evokes -- this slender volume conjures up a rich and deeply seductive, satisfying world, one that welcomes readers gay, straight, single, coupled or otherwise.</p><p> Despite its title and minor-key ending, Grief is not a depressing book. "Beauty does not lose its allure under the spell of grief," Holleran writes in one of his essays, and Grief is suffused with beauty -- not just the beauty of men but the beauty of the city whose streets the narrator wanders as though in a waking dream. I have never read a novel that so powerfully and movingly evokes D.C. -- its spirit, its ideal essence. "People never say anything nice about Washington," a character laments, but Grief provides a potent corrective. Like Cavafy leading one through the alleys and restaurants and history of Alexandria, Egypt, Holleran's narrator is a guide to the labyrinth of ambition, death, art and desire that lies within L'Enfant'scarefully executed grid of streets and parks: "The National Archives had the same cold light as the Tomb of Napoleon," he writes, "and the National Gallery made you feel, when you entered the echoing rotunda, and walked between its dark marble pillars, you were entering the palace of Pluto."</p><p>"They will make wonderful ruins," Sen. Thomas P. Gore, grandfather of Gore Vidal, once remarked to a visitor enthusing over Washington's architectural marvels. Until they do, they make a wonderful setting for Holleran's acute and often droll observations of the city.</p><p> The parallels between Grief's emotionally immured protagonist and Mary Lincoln, ravaged and ultimately destroyed by grief over her husband's death, are evident but not overplayed. And the narrator's decision as to how to live the remainder of his life seems as etched in stone as the words he reads on the city's monuments. Still, in the end, Holleran's moving novel is mostly about human resilience and hope; our enduring need to love, despite our losses. The beautiful life is brief: all the more reason to embrace it. </p><p>Reviewed by Elizabeth Hand <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

Dr. Hirsch is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and has been a senior fellow of the National Endowment for the Humanities. He is president of the Core Knowledge Foundation, a nonprofit organization devoted to educational reform.Preface to the Third Edition This new, updated edition reflects important changes that have occurred in the world since 1991, changes in history, science, and the arts that have become part of our common awareness, such as Harry Potter, the Persian Gulf War, El Nio, global warming, DVDs, laptop computers, and the recently named Southern Ocean. Most of the entries that appeared in the 1989 edition still appear here, illustrating how durable literate culture is and how valid was the idea that gave rise to this book: namely, that we can communicate with one another in our national community only because we continue to share and take for granted the knowledge that we hold in common. To possess this shared knowledge is to be a member of the cultural community to be an insider. Not to possess it is to be excluded from full communication with other members of the community to be an outsider. In our democracy we want all children to have the opportunity to be insiders. That is why we have made this book. That is also why my colleagues and I started the Core Knowledge Foundation (www.coreknowledge.org), whose mission is to bring this knowledge to all children through our schools. The entries in this book overlap with the topics studied in the early grades in Core Knowledge Schools. The overlap of the topics in this book with the topics studied in good schools is especially important today, when schools, under the influence of the national No Child Left Behind Act, are spending more and more classroom time trying to improve children&#39;s reading abilities. For children to understand writings in textbooks, magazines, books, and newspapers, they must possess the background knowledge that such writings take for granted. Cultural literacy and literacy are intertwined. Knowing the information contained in this book is a big step toward being a good reader and being a full participant in our society. Good luck!

For the last three days, he had been traveling with fourteen other recruits, headed to Camp Claiborne, seventeen miles southwest of Alexandria. There, they were to join a recently established armored unit. To Smith's surprise, the train stopped in an open field. The sergeants on the train threw the young soldiers' bags out and told them to get off. Smith and his companions, in full dress uniform and carrying their regulation duffel bags, waited for four hours in the empty field on the outskirts of the Kisatchie National Forest, watching the sun move across the sky. Finally, two of them set off on foot to find help.<br><br>Leonard Smith was one of the more than six hundred men who would come together at Camp Claiborne during the Second World War to form the 761st Tank Battalion. They would hail from over thirty states, from small towns and cities scattered throughout the country, from places as varied as Los Angeles, California, and Hotulka, Oklahoma; Springfield, Illinois, and Picayune, Mississippi; Billings, Montana, and Baltimore, Maryland. Most had volunteered. Some were the middle-class sons of doctors, undertakers, schoolteachers, and career military men; among the officers were a Yale student and a football star from UCLA who would later make his mark in American sports and American history. Many more were the sons of janitors, domestics, factory workers, and sharecroppers.<br><br>Their combat record in Europe during the war was noteworthy. They were to earn a Presidential Unit Citation for distinguished service, more than 250 Purple Hearts, 70 Bronze Stars, 11 Silver Stars, and a Congressional Medal of Honor in 183 straight days on the front lines of France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, Holland, and Austria. These accomplishments carried a significance, however, beyond the battlefield. The unit's official designation was "The 761st Tank Battalion (Colored)." As they waited in that hot Louisiana field, Leonard Smith and his fellow recruits were on their way to becoming part of the first African American unit in the history of the United States Army to fight in tanks.<br>In the fall of 1942, the battlefields of Europe and the Pacific seemed far from the backwater post of Camp Claiborne, Louisiana. They were as far from Leonard Smith's experience as Camp Claiborne had been before he boarded the train in New York City. Smith was born in Harlem Hospital on November 2, 1924; he was a sickly child at birth, weighing less than five pounds, with both colic and a heart murmur. His mother abandoned him shortly after he was born. Lulu Hasbruck, who worked for New York City taking in children with medical complications, cared for Smith during those early, precarious years. Other foster children regularly moved in and out of Hasbruck's home, but Smith and two girls, Thelma and Flora, remained. Smith would come to regard Lulu as his mother, though she never formally adopted him.<br><br>Despite his short, skinny frame and the heart murmur that kept him from playing school sports, Smith became an active, adventuresome child, regularly challenging other kids in his Brooklyn, and later Queens, neighborhood to footraces around the block. The neighborhood kids didn't seem to mind losing to him. There was something about him that adults and classmates immediately responded to, a combination of good-naturedness, irrepressibility, and na�vet� that made him impossible to dislike.<br><br>He loved singing, and was good enough even at age eight to solo with the senior choir at local churches. But his obsession was airplanes. A favorite teacher rewarded students for exceptional performance by buying them a toy of their choice from the neighborhood five-and-dime. Smith hated arithmetic, but he worked hard to get high marks so that she would have to buy him a toy. He invariably picked out model planes, pictures of planes, and books about planes. Though he had never seen an airplane up close, there was something about the idea of planes and flying, the freedom of movement flying symbolized, that endlessly fired his high-spirited imagination.<br><br>Money was scarce. Clothes for foster children were provided by the city, a source of some discomfort for the children: People knew they were "home" children, wards of the city, because of the way they dressed. But the only thing Smith really missed was not having a father. When other kids in the neighborhood would talk about things they'd done with their fathers, he would make up stories about fishing trips and family outings. When asked why his father wasn't around, he would tell his friends his father was traveling on business. He made an imaginary father out of Mrs. Hasbruck's deceased husband, George, collecting countless details about him: Mrs. Hasbruck told him that George had smoked a pipe with Prince Albert tobacco, and Smith vowed that when he grew up he'd do the same. Mrs. Hasbruck's two brothers gave Smith spending money from time to time, but they rarely provided him with fatherly guidance. He had to learn everything for himself, and he often made mistakes.<br><br>One such mistake contributed to his decision to enlist in the Army. As a teenager, he had enrolled at Chelsea Vocational High School to study aviation mechanics. There he fell in with a group of older boys, budding delinquents who played hooky every Friday, shoplifting tools from local stores. It was typical of the guileless Smith that he continued going to class long after the boys he hung out with had stopped. It was also typical that while Smith's adventuresomeness led him to skirt the edges of disaster, his good-naturedness and good luck just as often kept him out. A neighborhood cop who knew and liked Smith pulled him aside, telling him that the boys he was running around with were going to wind up in prison one way or another. "Have you ever considered joining the Army?" he asked.<br><br>Smith had considered it--it was May 1942, and the United States had been at war for six months--but at seventeen, he had thought he was too young to enlist. American troops were already engaging in bloody combat in the Pacific, surrendering after a hopelessly one-sided struggle in the Philippines on May 6, but stalling the advance of the Japanese two days later in the Battle of the Coral Sea. Like millions of families across the country, the Hasbrucks listened to the radio every night for war updates. When he went to the local cinema, Smith avidly watched the early newsreels of combat. He knew exactly what he wanted to enlist as: a fighter pilot. He imagined himself streaking through the skies, on the lookout for Japanese Zeros, engaging in dogfights, dropping bombs on enemy aircraft carriers. In Smith's young mind, war was a kind of game. He had no concept of war's brutality, and he was eager to join the fight. At the policeman's suggestion, he went to the induction office on Whitehall Street in lower Manhattan carrying a permission form signed by his foster mother.<br><br>The doctor administering the Army physical failed to notice his slight heart murmur, and passed him. Smith told the recruiter who processed his application that he wanted to be a pilot. The sergeant told him that was not possible--the Army Air Corps did not accept blacks. Smith barely managed to swallow his disappointment. Citing his training in high school, he then said he wanted to be an aviation mechanic. Again, he was told that was not possible. The Army's rigid color line took Smith by surprise. Growing up in the New York City of the 1920s and '30s, he had encountered his share of discrimination: There were certain neighborhood pools where he was not permitted to go swimming, and certain stores where the entrance of anybody black was announced by ringing bells to rouse white clerks to extra vigilance. But despite such small daily indignities, it had somehow never occurred to him that the color of his skin would impact his future, his lifelong dream of working with planes.<br><br>He had scored high marks on the Army's IQ screening test. "Infantry you definitely don't want," the sergeant advised him. The next-best thing to the air force was armored, the sergeant said. "Armored?" Smith asked. The sergeant replied, "Tanks. They're starting a couple of colored tank battalions. How would you like that?" Smith had never seen a tank--in fact, he had no idea what a tank was. But he was game for anything. The sergeant told him that as a volunteer, "if that's what you want, that's where you're going to go."<br>William McBurney was as reserved and cautious as Leonard Smith was naive and adventuresome. Although the two men didn't know each other, McBurney took the subway to the induction office just days after Smith. His motives in doing so were mixed. Like Smith, he had watched the news updates of the war: A wave of patriotism had swept the country in the wake of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and thousands of young men across the country enlisted every day. McBurney was eager to do his part for the war effort. But he also saw the Army as an escape.<br><br>McBurney was born in Harlem on May 21, 1924. His parents divorced when he was very young; his mother moved away to Florida, and he saw her only rarely after that. He was raised by his father and stepmother. When he was twelve years old, his younger brother died of scarlet fever. Though devastated by the loss, McBurney did what he had watched his father do all his life: bury the pain deep inside, and keep moving.<br><br>William had always been in awe of his father. A smart, determined, and ambitious man, his father had been born dirt poor around the turn of the century in Titusville, Florida. Seeing no prospects for advancement there, he had worked his way north to New York City as a railroad porter. At the outbreak of World War I, he had volunteered for the Army, serving in a quartermaster unit in Europe. When he returned to New York, still searching for a means of steady employment and advancement, he had worked his way through school to become a dental technician. But in the 1920s it was very difficult for blacks to find work in professional jobs. With a young wife and a growing family to support, he had no choice but to turn to manual labor, working on the docks and, later, with the advent of the Great Depression, for the Civilian Conservation Corps, one of the massive public works programs started by the federal government.<br><br>William McBurney was an intelligent, active boy. Despite his large size, he was not coordinated or good at sports: His one physical gift was a powerful right hook. Though he never went out of his way to seek out a fight, neither did he ever turn away from one. He got into the usual number of scrapes for a kid in Harlem in the 1930s--often chasing or being chased by Italian kids from adjacent neighborhoods--but he was also always at one remove from whatever he was doing, thinking several steps ahead. He had already noticed the kinds of trouble young black men often got into, especially with the police, and he intended to avoid it. With his air of watchfulness, his quiet, steady intelligence, and his physical courage, he stood out in his group of friends as the one you wanted watching your back.<br><br>Like Smith and countless other African Americans at that time, McBurney was tracked early in his school career toward shop class, regardless of his intelligence or academic success. Given the options available to him at New York Vocational High School, like Leonard Smith he chose to study aviation mechanics. A female cousin was taking flying lessons at Floyd Bennet Field, and watching that plane take off and sail away made McBurney dream of becoming a pilot. But as time went on, it was a dream he seemed to have less and less hope of attaining. After school and on Saturdays he worked at a paintbrush factory for twenty-five cents an hour, helping his family to weather the Depression. Many of his friends had taken similar menial jobs. As high school graduation approached, many more of his friends, with no real opportunities for advancement, were falling into gambling and petty theft. McBurney saw himself and his friends moving steadily toward dead-end lives.<br><br>Like many young men, he had romanticized his father's service in World War I--the more so because his taciturn father never talked about it. He saw the Army as a way of creating a new life for himself, and of realizing his secret dream of flying. When he told his father he wanted to join the Army Air Corps, he was surprised to find his father immediately dismissive. He didn't believe the Air Corps would accept an African American. This only made McBurney more determined. Three days after his eighteenth birthday, he took the train to the recruitment center on Whitehall Street.<br><br>His father's warning about the Air Corps turned out to be all too true--as Leonard Smith had already discovered, no blacks were allowed to join. To McBurney, it was a slap in the face. Nonetheless, he decided to enlist. Like Smith, he had scored high marks on the Army's intelligence test. Though he also had no idea what a tank was, he found himself, like Smith, steered by the recruiter into armored.<br>After passing his physical and being given his shots, McBurney was sent by train with several other fresh recruits to Camp Upton, a processing center surrounded by open potato fields in Suffolk County, Long Island. Thousands of Army recruits would move through the sprawling complex between 1941 and 1945. The recruits spent two weeks living in tents, where they were given close haircuts, uniforms, and basic gear; then they were moved into barracks. They performed a series of marching and close-order drills each day, learning the basics of military procedure and decorum, as well as carrying out KP duty and cleaning the grounds of the camp. Finding themselves with a great deal of free time on their hands, they held a series of boxing and softball tournaments as they waited endlessly, it seemed to McBurney, for their orders to come. During orientation, they had seen motivational documentaries chronicling the reasons the country was at war, highlighting the battles that had been fought to date, and firing them up against Germany and Japan. All were eager to get overseas and get started. They wanted in on the action.<br><br>The close friendships that would characterize the men in combat were already begining to form. William McBurney first met Leonard Smith at Camp Upton. Despite, or perhaps because of, their vast temperamental differences--Smith was the sort who leapt before looking, while McBurney was the one who held back; Smith's humor tended toward open-hearted playfulness, McBurney's toward irony and observation--the two became fast friends. Soon they became close to another recruit as well, soft-spoken Preston McNeil.</p><h2>A Splintered History of Wood: Belt-Sander Races, Blind Woodworkers, and Baseball Bats</h2><p><p> In a world without wood, we might not be here at all. We wouldn't have had the fire, heat, and shelter that allowed us to expand into the planet's colder regions. If civilization somehow did develop, our daily lives would be vastly different: there would be no violins, baseball bats, chopsticks, or wine corks. The book you are now holding wouldn't exist. </p> <p> Spike Carlsen's <i>A Splintered History of Wood</i> is a grand celebration of all things wooden and the characters who lovingly shape them&#x2014;eccentric artisans and passionate enthusiasts who have created some of the world's most beloved musical instruments, feared weapons, dazzling architecture, and bizarre forms of transportation. From champion chainsaw carvers to blind woodworkers, from the Miraculous Staircase to the Lindbergh kidnapping case, here is a passionate, personal, amazingly entertaining exploration of nature's greatest gift. </p></p><p><p>SPIKE CARLSEN is an editor, carpenter, woodworker, and author of the award-winning A&nbsp;,&nbsp;which was featured as&nbsp;an NPR &#x201c;Best Books of 2008&#x201d; and 2008 MBA Midwest Connections Pick.&nbsp;A former executive editor of&nbsp;&nbsp;magazine, he has written for&nbsp;,&nbsp;,&nbsp;, and many other publications.&nbsp;</p>Adult/High School&#x2013;Carlsen explores our reliance on wood from numerous angles. A carpenter, woodworker, and author of dozens of books and articles on home improvement, he knows his subject well, and his love and respect for trees and all things made from them are evident on each page. The author includes just enough of the science of trees and wood, and of the technology of wood products and woodworking, to inform but not burden lay readers. Numerous stories add immeasurably to the books appeal. Readers are told how a Steinway piano is built, why a Stradivarius violin is so special, about the role of the long bow in military history, and how pens and pencils evolved. In addition, there are discussions of the offbeat, including a full-scale (and functional) Ferrari carved of wood, the 36-year remodeling project known as the Winchester House, a staircase with no visible means of support, and the use of wood forensics in the Lindbergh kidnapping case. Carlsen explores the extraordinary variety of woods on our planet, the profession and hobby of fine woodworking, the tools used to work wood, and the many uses of it in our lives&#x2013;in music, sports, shelter, furniture, weapons, and transportation. The volume ends with a word on the highly complex issues surrounding human use of the worlds forests and the consequent effects on the global environment. Black-and-white photos are included. Thoroughly researched, thoughtful, and entertaining.<i>&#x2013;Robert Saunderson, Berkeley Public Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It was an Ideally Situated Outlet Village&#x2014;an Ultra-Convenient Complex For The Ultra-Modern Consumer. It was where Quality met Design to form an Affordable Union. It might have been a Stately Pleasure Dome. It was possibly a Garden Of Earthly Delight. It was almost cer�tainly where Capital Letters went to Die. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More precisely, it was on the outskirts of one of Lon�don&#x2019;s northwest satellite towns, and, viewed from above, resembled a glass and steel rendering of a giant octopus dropped headfirst onto the landscape. In the gaps between its outstretched tentacles were parks and play areas and public conveniences, and at each of its two main entrances were garages offering, in addition to the usual services, full valet coverage, 4-wheel alignment and diagnostic analysis, as well as free air and a Last-Minute One-Stop-Shop. Cart stations&#x2014;colored pennants hoisted above them for swift location&#x2014;were positioned at those intervals market research had determined user-friendly, and were assiduously tended by liveried cart-jockeys. From ten minutes before dusk until ten after daybreak the area was bathed in gentle orange light, the quiet humming of CCTV cameras a constant reminder that your security was Whiteoaks&#x2019; concern. And in a hedged-off corner between the center&#x2019;s electricity substa�tion and one of four home-delivery loading bays&#x2014;perhaps the only point in the complex to which the word &#x201c;accessible&#x201d; did not apply&#x2014;lurked a furtive row of recycling bins, like a consumerist <i>memento mori</i>.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the interior, it was a contemporary cathedral, sacred to the pursuit of retail opportunity. There was a food mall, a clothing avenue, an entertainment hall; there were wings dedicated to white goods (&#x201c;all your domestic requirements sat�isfied!&#x201d;), pampering (&#x201c;full body tan in minutes!&#x201d;) and financial services (&#x201c;consolidate your debts&#x2014;ask us how!&#x201d;). There was a boulevard of sporting goods, a bridleway of gardening supplies; a veritable Hatton Garden of jewelers. No franchise ever heard of went unrepresented, and several never before encountered had multiple outlets. Whiteoaks&#x2019; delicatessens carried sweet�meats from as near as Abbotsbury and as far as Zywocice; its bookshops shelved volumes by every author its readers could imagine, from Bill Bryson to Jeremy Clarkson. The shopper who is tired of Whiteoaks, it might easily be asserted, is a shopper who is tired of credit. During the summer, light washed down from the recessed contours of its cantilevered ceilings, and during the winter it did exactly the same. Temperature, too, was regulated and constant, and in this it matched everything else. At Whiteoaks, you could buy raspberries in winter and tinsel in July. Seasonal variation was discouraged as an unnecessary brake on impulse purchasing.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which was not to say that Whiteoaks ignored the pas�sage of the year; rather, it measured the months in a manner appropriate to its customers&#x2019; needs. As surely as Father&#x2019;s Day follows Mother&#x2019;s, as unalterably as Harry Potter gives way to the Great Pumpkin, time marches on; its inevitable progress registering as peaks and troughs in a never-ending flow chart.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For there are only seventeen Major Feasts in the calendar of the Complete Retail Experience.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the greatest of these is Christmas. <br> &nbsp;<br> At Whiteoaks Christmas slipped in slowly, sublimi�nally, with the faint rustle of a paperchain in early September, and the echo of a jingle bell as October turned. Showing almost saintly restraint, however, it did not unleash its reindeer until Halloween had been wholly remaindered. After that, it was open season. Taking full advantage of its layout, the complex boasted eight Santa&#x2019;s Grottos&#x2014;one per tentacle&#x2014;each employing a full complement of sleigh, sacks, elves, snowflakes, friendly squirrels, startled rabbits, and (coun�terintuitively, but fully validated by merchandise-profiling) talking zebras. And, of course, each had its own Santa. Or, more accurately, each had an equal share in a rotating pool of Santas, for the eight Santas hired annually by the Whiteoaks Festive Governance Committee had swiftly worked out that no single one of them wanted to spend an entire two-month hitch marooned in Haberdashery&#x2019;s backwater, or worse still, abandoned under fire in the high-pressure, noise-intensive combat zone of Toys and Games, while another took his ease in the Food Hall, pampered with cake and cappuccino by the surrounding franchisees. So a complicated but workable shift system had been established by the Santas themselves, whereby they chopped and changed each two-hour session, swapping grottos three times a day and generally sharing the burden along with the spoils. This worked so well, so much to everyone&#x2019;s satisfaction, that the first eight Santas hired by the Governance Committee remained the only Santas Whiteoaks needed, returning year after year to don their uniforms, attach their beards, and maintain an impressive 83% record of hardly ever swearing at children whose parents were in earshot.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Santa-ing was not an easy undertaking. It was not a task for sissies. And while the Usual Santas didn&#x2019;t always do things by the book, by God, they got the job done!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And each year, once they&#x2019;d managed just that&#x2014;after the shops had lowered shutters on Christmas Eve, and Whiteoaks slumbered, preparatory to the Boxing Day rush&#x2014;the Santas met in a hospitality room adjoining the security suite, and relaxed over a buffet provided by the grateful merchants of the quarter, and exchanged war stories until the hour grew late, and generally luxuriated in the absence of children.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But however relaxed they grew, they kept their beards on. And remained zipped inside their red suits. And never addressed each other as anything other than &#x201c;Santa&#x201d;; and in fact, would have been unable to do so had they wanted, because while they might, for all they knew, be friends and neighbors in civvy street&#x2014;might drink in the same pub, or regularly catch the same bus to the same football ground&#x2014;on duty they remained in uniformed character, and always had done. This had started in jest but had quickly hardened into custom. Not long after that, it calcified into supersti�tion. In their dealings with toddlers and hyperactive infants, the Usual Santas had suffered in undignified, frequently unhygienic ways that had bonded them in a manner few civilians could hope to understand, but on every other level they were strangers to each other. And with this, they were perfectly comfortable.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until, one day . . .</p><h2>Blessed Are the Crazy: Breaking the Silence about Mental Illness, Family and Church (Young Clergy Women Project)</h2><p>When do you learn that "normal" doesn't include lots of yelling, lots of sleeping, lots of beating?

I am not aware of a more valuable first resource to help shape our thinking on this very contemporary issue." &#x2014;Dr. Fred G. Zaspel, Calvary Baptist Seminary</b><br><br>Homosexuality is one of the most controversial moral issues of our day. Headlines teem with stories of athletes &#x201c;coming out,&#x201d; politicians changing positions, and courts handing down same-sex marriage rulings. <br>Sadly the church has often been afraid to talk about homosexuality. Many Christians feel confused and divided between the call to love and the call for truth. And many who struggle with unwanted same-sex attraction feel alone and alienated by the church. <br>The time is ripe for God&#x2019;s people to think and speak about same-sex attraction in a way that is both biblical and beneficial. We must reject our fears and misunderstandings and see ourselves together in need of the grace of Jesus. <i>Love Into Light</i> is designed to move the church toward that end. <br><b>Written from the heart of a pastor with a love for people and a sensitivity to our culture, <i>Love Into Light</i> is your next step toward becoming more faithfully and helpfully engaged with people in your families, in your church and in your neighborhood.</b></p><p>Peter Hubbard is Teaching Pastor at North Hills Community Church in Taylors, SC, where he has communicated the truth of the scriptures since the church began in 1992.

The good ones bring peace, joy and power into our lives, and the bad ones steal our peace and joy and prevent our success. <br><br>In this book, Joyce Meyer explains how to develop good habits--the things you really want to do--and break the bad ones, putting an end to frustration, discouragement and stress that drains your energy. <br><br>The most important habit comes first: the God habit.

This, and a fresh re-imagining of Bushnell's info-graphic, will assist readers in following her closely-argued case.</p> <p> </p> <p>Biblical scholar, social activist, physician and missionary and linguist, Katherine Bushnell was an extraordinarily gifted and inspirational leader frequently credited with the awakening of the women's empowerment movement within the Church.</p> <p>In her masterpiece, God's Word to Women, she carefully argues the case that women should learn directly from the words of God, by educating themselves and taking the initiative. </p> <p> A timeless classic that includes her stunning chart explaining how male scholars, perhaps unintentionally, have changed their choice of words down the centuries, leaving the current English versions of the bible attributing "lust" or "desire" to women, when these sentiments may not have been in the original biblical source documents.</p></p><p>Katherine Bushnell (1856-1946)was a medical doctor who sensed God calling her to be a missionary preacher. She told God that if He would prove to her that Paul was not against women preaching, she would obey. After years of diligent study, which included becoming proficient in both Hebrew and Greek, Bushnell was convinced that the Bible teaches the equality of the sexes--that inequality came with the fall and humanity turning away from God, but that the original equality was restored through the redemptive work of Jesus Christ. She discovered that Paul, rightly understood and interpreted, was not against women leading and preaching. This volume, first published in 1921, is the fruit of her labors.Katherine Bushnell was a ground-breaking author in the area of gender equality. Her book became an inspiration for many, both men and women who have continued her research into how the church fell away from the egalitarian message of Jesus and early Christianity. --Dr. Eddie L.

In addition to describing Lahiri&#x2019;s Seven Steps of Kriya (beginning to advanced techniques), and as a Kriya-for-all, mindful work, &#x201c;Kriya Secrets Revealed&#x201d; also includes descriptions of variations of the Lahiri lessons as presented by different main-line Kriya schools. Readers will also find a reprint of Swami Yogananda&#x2019;s Kriya (i.e. &#x201c;Art of Super Realization,&#x201d; 1930, now public domain) and information from several other sources related to the practice of Kriya. For those who appreciate a starting point, worksheets with suggested practice routines are offered as well. The essays sprinkled throughout the book were written based on the author&#x2019;s (J.C. Stevens&#x2019;) insights, which reflect three decades of regular Kriya practice and years of research, including research into original texts relating to Kriya. These essays are meant to provide context for the author&#x2019;s perspective, satisfy reader curiosity, and as discussions surrounding the theories and philosophies of Lahiri Mahasaya. For reader convenience, a glossary of Sanskrit and other non-English terms, as well as an Index, are also included. </p><p> Why was this information published for the public? J.C. Stevens, the book&#x2019;s author, practiced Kriya for decades without reaching his higher spiritual goals. As a graduate of Physics from UCLA, he knew that the science behind Kriya was sound; but as a practicing yogi, his intuition was telling him that there was more to Kriya than he had been taught through the (Kriya-based) church he attended growing up. In 2013, after Stevens had answered many of his own questions about Kriya through independent research, he made the decision to reveal what he had learned in the form of a book/practical workbook for other aspirants who felt the need to delve deeper into their Kriya practice (i.e. &#x201c;Kriya Secrets Revealed: Lessons and Techniques Workbook&#x201d;). </p><p> Note from the author: &#x201c;If you are currently a member of an organization that teaches Kriya, the information in this book may surprise you or challenge your beliefs. Please know that nothing contained within its pages is meant to disrupt anyone&#x2019;s previous personal beliefs, but merely to assist or enlighten those who have sensed missing information about Kriya and its practice. In gathering knowledge in the formation of this book, every source was researched, including original text held in the National Library of India, which, with the help of Bangla translators, I studied and, in some cases, re-translated through a growing understanding of the text&#x2019;s language, as well as through intuition gained from practicing Kriya. The decision to publish these findings was also the result of my own frustration with finding variations of Kriya on the Internet that professed to be the &#x2018;only true Kriya.&#x2019; I trust that this book will help other likeminded souls avoid this same frustration.&#x201d; - J.C. Stevens </p><p> Lahiri Mahasaya repeatedly reminded his students, &#x201c;Do not wait for advice to practice Kriya,&#x201d; urging them to break free of limited thoughts and to become supremely Self-empowered, recognizing that the ability to understand the universe lies within. Only a starting point is necessary. Kriya Yoga can serve as that point.</p></p><p>At nine years old, JC Stevens began attending weekly Sunday school services at a Temple that offered Kriya Yoga to its adult followers, and beginning meditation practices to its children members. As soon as Stevens reached the allowable age (17 years old), he received initiation into Kriya Yoga by a monastic in the same organization. In 1994, Stevens earned a degree in Physics from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), as one of the top three students in the Physics Department. A few years after receiving his undergraduate degree, he was offered instant enrollment into a UCLA graduate program, where he pursued studies in Engineering and taught Physics to undergraduates. As any true seeker, he remained dedicated to his Kriya practice and the pursuit of living a righteous, God-centered life. In building a career after college, Stevens lived in several countries around the world and on three continents. During this time he mastered the German language and learned conversational Swedish, Czech, Spanish and Russian. Through decades of research into religious history and theory, he developed skills in Sanskrit. Stevens currently resides in a small town in Western Europe. Similarly to Lahiri Mahasaya, he is a householder himself. Theirs is a home filled with love and effervescent devotion to God. In addition to fulfilling his familial and work responsibilities, Stevens assists others in his community.</p><h2>Diagnosis and Treatment of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome - second edition</h2><p>Since its publication in April 2014, Dr Myhill s guide to understanding and overcoming CFS/ME has become a must-read for sufferers from this poorly understood condition.

He makes the provocative case that to remedy this problem, we should return to teaching religion in the public schools. Alongside "reading, writing, and arithmetic," religion ought to become the "Fourth R" of American education. </p> <p> Many believe that America's descent into religious illiteracy was the doing of activist judges and secularists hell-bent on banishing religion from the public square. Prothero reveals that this is a profound misunderstanding. "In one of the great ironies of American religious history," Prothero writes, "it was the nation's most fervent people of faith who steered us down the road to religious illiteracy.</p></p><p><p>Stephen Prothero is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Religious Literacy</em> and <em>God Is Not One</em> and a professor of religion at Boston University.

Visit the author at www.stephenprothero.com or follow his tweets @sprothero.<em></em></p>Taking its cue from Hirsch's benchmark NEW DICTIONARY OF CULTURAL LITERACY (1988), this is an important book for an important time. Addressing the need for Americans to be fully conversant in the essential teachings of all major religions (Christian religion, in particular, but not exclusively), the author makes the bold assertion that religion should be taught in schools. Prothero, the chair of the Department of Religion at Boston University, is oddly mild in his reading. His words are slightly clipped, and, even though he reads his own book, some emphases and stresses sound strangely off. He speaks too close to the microphone, or perhaps not loudly enough, necessitating extra amplification, causing many slight but audible whistles and chirps throughout the reading.

The tribes formulated racial and gender ideologies that justified this practice and marginalized free black people in the Indian nations well after the Civil War and slavery had ended.

A former game designer and editor, he lives in southern Wisconsin with his wife, Andria.Chapter One<br><br>The air aboard the Thrackan Sal-Solo was filled with new-vessel smells-the acrid bite of ventilation fans burning off packing grease, the sweetness of escaped actuating gas, the ozone tinge of fresh-air exchangers. As Han and Leia Solo passed through hatchway after hatchway, Han still found himself touching the durasteel bulkheads to be sure he wasn't dreaming.<br><br>The Sal-Solo was the flagship of a secret assault fleet that the Corellian government had put into construction nearly ten standard years before, under the leadership of Han's recently deceased cousin, Thrackan Sal-Solo. Nobody would say what Sal-Solo and his cohorts had been planning for the mysterious armada, and Han didn't care. The fleet was ready to deploy and large enough to shatter the Alliance blockade, and that was all that mattered. The blockade had been extended to all five planets in the Corellian System, choking their economics and threatening their off-world facilities.<br><br>When the Solos reached the Command Center, Han did not need to be a Jedi to feel the excitement in the air. The door guards inspected everyone's passes with more than the usual cursory nod, and they even ran a security scan on C-3PO. Inside, the support officers had forsaken the caf dispenser and were actually at their duty carrels, studying data displays and coding orders. The only individuals who did not seem busy were half a dozen civilian security agents waiting on steel benches outside the Tactical Planning Salon, and even they sat in tense silence.<br><br>Han leaned close to Leia and asked in a whisper, "Will you be okay with this?"<br><br>Leia looked up and arched a brow. The lines at the corners of her dark eyes only made her gaze that much more penetrating . . . and, well, wise.<br><br>"Okay with what, Han?"<br><br>"Being married to a Corellian admiral." Han smirked and ran his fingers over his chin, clean-shaven now that there was no longer a need to hide his identity from his cousin's assassins. "Look around. Wedge is getting ready to bust the blockade, and he's going to need me to take one of the Dreadnaughts."<br><br>Leia surveyed the busy cabin, allowing her gaze to rest on the security agents outside the planning salon. "I don't think we need to worry about that, Han."<br><br>Han frowned. "You think I'm too old for a line command?"<br><br>"Hardly. You're not even seventy yet." Leia lowered her voice, then added, "I just have a feeling."<br><br>"Oh dear," C-3PO said. "It's never good when Mistress Leia has a feeling."<br><br>They reached the door to the planning salon and had to end the conversation. Instead of admitting them immediately as he had the previous day, the door guard-a square-jawed petty officer in a blue duty uniform-blocked their way.<br><br>"The admiral will be with you as soon as he can, Captain Solo."<br><br>"As soon as he can?" Han was starting to think Leia's feeling might be right. "He called us."<br><br>"Yes, sir, I'm aware of that." The door guard studied Han with the weary smirk that Corellians reserved for grandstanders and blowhards. "Admiral Antilles is a very busy man."<br><br>"Yeah?" Han was growing embarrassed by his earlier confidence-and nothing made him testier than embarrassing himself in front of Leia. "Well, so am I."<br><br>Before Han could turn to leave, Leia caught him by the arm. "Tell Admiral Antilles to take his time," she said to the guard. "We understand how busy he must be right now."<br><br>Han did not resist as she pulled him to one side of the door. Wedge Antilles had been appointed Supreme Commander of the Corellian forces some ten standard days earlier-the day after Thrackan Sal-Solo's assassination-and Han knew as well as anyone how hectic his schedule had to be right now. <br><br>That was why the Solos had been so surprised to receive a message asking them to rendezvous with Antilles in the Kiris Asteroid Cluster. The Kirises were so far out on the fringes of the system that they were almost free floating, and so obscure that even Han had been forced to ask for coordinates. The Solos had spent the better part of the trip-made even longer by the necessity of evading the Galactic Alliance blockade-debating what the blazes Corellia's new Supreme Commander was doing so far from the war.<br><br>All their questions had been answered when they rounded Kiris 6 and saw the Sal-Solo floating in her hidden dock. The Dreadnaught was a typical Corellian design-innovative, austere, and configured for vicious, close-in combat, with turbolaser turrets and missile tubes arrayed heavily and uniformly over a blue, egg-shaped hull. Han had known the moment he saw her that the ship was exactly what Corellia needed, a vessel capable of plunging into the core of the Alliance blockade and tearing it apart from the inside.<br><br>But Han's pulse had not quickened until a couple of hours later, when Antilles had informed them that the Sal-Solo had two sister ships and an entire support fleet hidden in the Kiris Cluster's other shipyards. Given the obvious element of surprise, Antilles felt sure the fleet would be powerful enough to smash the blockade and convince the Alliance to reconsider its war plans. What he had wanted to know from Han was whether he and Leia considered an early end to the war a strong enough possibility to serve in the Corellian military.<br><br>Han and Leia had spent the night agonizing over Antilles's question, worrying about whether Han would eventually find himself in battle against his own children. Jaina was now serving with the Jedi instead of the military, and Jacen was supposedly back on Coruscant torturing Corellians, but war had a way of bringing about the unforeseen. If Han ended up killing one of his own children, he would shatter into more pieces than there were stars in the galaxy.<br><br>The question posed a dilemma for Leia, as well. Four years ago, when her Master, Saba Sebatyne, had proclaimed her a Jedi Knight, she had sworn to obey the Jedi Council even when she disagreed with it, and the Council was supporting the Galactic Alliance. So far, Saba and the other Masters had been tolerating her insubordination out of respect for who she was. But that would certainly change if Han openly took arms against the Alliance. The Council would have no choice except to demand that she choose between Han and the Jedi.<br><br>Still, the only other alternative was to stand by and watch the war blossom without them, and the Solos had never been the type to do nothing. In the end, they had decided the best course of action was to put Coruscant in a more reasonable frame of mind by helping Antilles prove that a war would be as costly for the Galactic Alliance as it was for Corellia. After the blockade was smashed, the new administration would be in a position to negotiate from strength, and Leia would secure the peace by volunteering to act as an envoy.<br><br>That was why Han had been so disappointed to be denied admittance to the planning salon. He and Leia had made up their minds to risk everything to help Antilles end this war quickly. Now it looked as though their help was no longer wanted.<br><br>The wait was shorter than Han had expected. He had barely started to consider a trip to the caf dispenser when Wedge Antilles arrived in his white admiral's uniform. His tapered face was creased with wrinkles and worry lines, and his neatly trimmed hair was now more gray than brown.<br><br>"Han, Leia-I'm sorry for the delay," Antilles said. As the door slid shut behind him, Han glimpsed the back of a civilian head nodding vigorously as someone else spoke in sharp tones. "Have you decided?"<br><br>"Yeah." Han began to feel a little more optimistic; perhaps Antilles was just having a difficult meeting with a couple of civilian bigwigs. "I was kind of thinking of signing on."<br><br>"Glad to hear it!" Antilles smiled and stuck out his hand, but there was more apprehension in his face than warmth. "We have an important job for you."<br><br>Han clasped the offered hand, but Leia continued to study Antilles with an expression of reserve. "We're looking forward to hearing about it," she said, "so we can make a final decision."<br><br>Antilles did his best to look disappointed, but made the mistake of quietly letting his breath out through his nose. It was an old sabacc tell, and one that Han knew always meant relief. Whatever was going on here, it was beginning to smell like a Hutt's belly.<br><br>"That's right," Han said. "Why don't you tell us what you have in mind?"<br><br>"Fair enough." Antilles drew them away from the door guard and lowered his voice. "We need you to negotiate a coalition."<br><br>"Negotiate?" Han scowled. "I thought you wanted me in the military."<br><br>"Maybe later." Antilles did not sound too serious. "Right now, this is more important."<br><br>"I must say, trusting Captain Solo to negotiate anything other than an asteroid belt seems foolish," C-3PO said. "His temperament is poorly suited to diplomacy."<br><br>"Han is a man of hidden talents." Antilles kept his gaze fixed on Han. "There's no one else I would trust with this mission."<br><br>Han pondered the compliment only a moment before deciding his friend was feeding him a load of bantha poodoo. "This is about Jacen, isn't it?"<br><br>Antilles frowned. "Jacen?" He shook his head. "Han, we both have kids fighting on the other side of this thing."<br><br>"Syal isn't torturing Corellians on Coruscant," Han countered. As angry and ashamed as he was about what Jacen had become, he wasn't going to hide from it. "Look, I don't like what Jacen is doing any more than you do, but he's still my kid, and I'm not going to disown him. I'll understand if you've got a problem with that."<br><br>"Han, I don't," Antilles replied. "Jacen has lost his way, but it's only because he believes in what he's fighting for. Sooner or later, he's going to remember that you and Leia taught him right from wrong, and he's going to find his way back."<br><br>Leia reached out and squeezed Antilles's hand. "Thank you, Wedge," she said. "I know that's true, but it feels good to hear someone else say it."<br><br>"Yeah, it makes you think maybe you're not crazy after all." Han turned away so he could blink a tear out of his eye, then looked back to Antilles. "So what do you really want me for?"<br><br>"I told you," Antilles said. "To negotiate a coalition."<br><br>As he spoke, the admiral's eyes shifted toward Leia, and Han realized the truth was he wanted Leia to negotiate the coalition.<br><br>Han shook his head. "For once, Threepio is right-you don't want to ask me to negotiate any kind of coalition. I might start a war or something."<br><br>Antilles gave a theatrical sigh. "Come on, Han." He briefly shifted his gaze to Leia again. "You understand what I'm asking."<br><br>"Then ask," Han said. "You know how I hate games."<br><br>"Very well." Antilles turned to Leia, and his eyes began to blink more rapidly-another old sabacc tell that usually meant your opponent was trying to pull a fast one. "You understand this can't be an official request-"<br><br>"Why not?" Han interrupted.<br><br>"Because I'm not Corellian," Leia said. "And I'm a Jedi Knight. It would look suspicious for me to conduct negotiations."<br><br>"So you want me to be the front man?" Han continued to look at Antilles.<br><br>Antilles nodded. "Exactly."<br><br>"Not interested," Han said, not even pretending to consider the request. He could not ask Leia to negotiate on behalf of a cause that even he knew she supported only partially, especially when Antilles himself so clearly had reservations about what he was asking. Besides, Han had a sneaking suspicion that his old friend was deliberately trying to discourage the Solos from accepting the assignment. "Call me when you need someone to do some fighting."<br><br>He turned to leave, but Leia caught him by the arm. "Han, shouldn't we hear Admiral Antilles out?"<br><br>"What for?"<br><br>"For Corellia." Leia fixed him with a stern-eyed gaze that worked better on him than any Jedi Force suggestion. "You're always talking about the importance of preserving Corellia's independent spirit. Is sitting at a negotiating table really so much to ask?"<br><br>Han's jaw dropped. Leia had renounced her role as a senior diplomat during the war with the Yuuzhan Vong, when it had grown apparent that the political process was only undermining the New Republic's ability to win the war. That she would volunteer to resume the role now-on Corellia's behalf-seemed very suspicious.<br><br>He scowled. "You want to do this?" <br><br>"I'm willing to consider it." Leia turned back to Antilles. "But we're not making a decision before we hear the details-all the details."<br><br>"No one expects that." Antilles smiled, but the note of disappointment in his voice was unmistakable-at least to someone who had known him for forty years. "My orders were simply to find out if you'd be willing to consider it. Prime Minister Gejjen will brief you on the rest."<br><br>Han's brow rose. Dur Gejjen had risen to power by helping Han and Boba Fett assassinate Han's megalomaniac cousin, Thrackan Sal-Solo. Afterward, Gejjen had abolished the office of President of Five Worlds, which Sal-Solo had created for the sole purpose of exerting his personal dominion over the entire Corellian system. Had Gejjen stopped there, Han would have admired his integrity and wisdom. But Gejjen had proved to be just as bad as Sal-Solo, establishing his own hold by arranging to have himself named both Chief of State of the planet Corellia and Five Worlds Prime Minister.<br>"Gejjen is here?" Han asked. "You have got to be kidding."<br><br>"I'm afraid not."<br><br>Antilles led the way into the planning salon, a spacious cabin lined with the latest battle-coordination technology: half-wall display screens, a ceiling-mounted tactical holoprojector, automatic caf dispensers in each corner. Dur Gejjen and two others sat talking at a large oval conference table with a combination data/comm station at every seat.<br><br>As soon as Han and Leia entered the room, Gejjen ended the conversation and extended his hand. "Captain Solo, welcome." He was young and good looking, with dark skin and black hair worn in a short military-style cut. "I'm so pleased you agreed to accept this assignment."<br><br>"Yeah, well, don't be too pleased," Han said. "I haven't accepted anything yet."<br><br>He gave Gejjen's hand a single pump, then looked past him to the others. They were older-the first a sandy-haired man with a blocky jaw and graying mustache, the second a middle-aged woman with a round face and cold gray eyes. Han wasn't familiar enough with the new government to recognize them by sight, but he was guessing by Antilles's displeasure and the number of security agents waiting outside that they were Gavele Lemora and Rorf Willems. Along with Gejjen, Lemora and Willems were the heart of the Five Worlds government, with Lemora serving as minister of intelligence and Willems as the minister of defense.<br><br>Gejjen frowned in Antilles's direction. "I thought you weren't to bring them in here unless-"<br><br>"Admiral Antilles's request was necessarily rather vague," Leia interrupted. "Han will need to know a few more details before he can agree to serve as your emissary."<br><br>"Ah-of course." Gejjen glanced over his shoulder at the cold-eyed woman-Lemora-and looked relieved. "We'll be happy to give him a basic briefing."<br><br>"After the droid leaves," Lemora added, staring at C-3PO.<br><br>"I can't leave!" C-3PO objected. "I won't be able to record the briefing."<br><br>"That's the point, chiphead," Willems said. He had a gravelly voice and a thuggish demeanor. "We don't want it recorded."<br><br>"Are you certain?" C-3PO inquired. "Captain Solo's memory circuits have been showing signs of fatigue lately. Just the other day, he told Princess Leia that with her new short haircut, she didn't look...</p><h2>The Compatriots: The Brutal and Chaotic History of Russia&#39;s Exiles, �migr�s, and Agents Abroad</h2><p><b>The authors of <i>The Red Web</i> examine the shifting role of Russian expatriates throughout history, and their complicated, unbreakable relationship with the mother country--be it antagonistic or far too chummy.<br><br></b>The history of Russian espionage is soaked in blood, from a spontaneous pistol shot that killed a secret policeman in Romania in 1924 to the attempt to poison an exiled KGB colonel in Salisbury, England, in 2017.

The exodus created a rare opportunity for the Kremlin. Moscow's masters and spymasters fostered networks of spies, many of whom were emigrants driven from Russia. By the 1930s and 1940s, dozens of spies were in New York City gathering information for Moscow.<br>But the story did not end with the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Yet, members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have struggled for status and recognition. In this book, W. Paul Reeve explores the ways in which nineteenth century Protestant white America made outsiders out of an inside religious group. Much of what has been written on Mormon otherness centers upon economic, cultural, doctrinal, marital, and political differences that set Mormons apart from mainstream America. Reeve instead looks at how Protestants racialized Mormons, using physical differences in order to define Mormons as non-White to help justify their expulsion from Ohio, Missouri, and Illinois. He analyzes and contextualizes the rhetoric on Mormons as a race with period discussions of the Native American, African American, Oriental, Turk/Islam, and European immigrant races. He also examines how Mormon male, female, and child bodies were characterized in these racialized debates. For instance, while Mormons argued that polygamy was ordained by God, and so created angelic, celestial, and elevated offspring, their opponents suggested that the children were degenerate and deformed.<br><br>The Protestant white majority was convinced that Mormonism represented a racial-not merely religious-departure from the mainstream and spent considerable effort attempting to deny Mormon whiteness. Being white brought access to political, social, and economic power, all aspects of citizenship in which outsiders sought to limit or prevent Mormon participation. At least a part of those efforts came through persistent attacks on the collective Mormon body, ways in which outsiders suggested that Mormons were physically different, racially more similar to marginalized groups than they were white. Medical doctors went so far as to suggest that Mormon polygamy was spawning a new race. Mormons responded with aspirations toward whiteness. It was a back and forth struggle between what outsiders imagined and what Mormons believed. Mormons ultimately emerged triumphant, but not unscathed. Mormon leaders moved away from universalistic ideals toward segregated priesthood and temples, policies firmly in place by the early twentieth century. So successful were Mormons at claiming whiteness for themselves that by the time Mormon Mitt Romney sought the White House in 2012, he was labeled "the whitest white man to run for office in recent memory." Ending with reflections on ongoing views of the Mormon body, this groundbreaking book brings together literatures on religion, whiteness studies, and nineteenth century racial history with the history of politics and migration.<br></p><p><br><strong>W. Paul Reeve</strong> is Associate Professor of History at the University of Utah. He is the author of <em>Making Space on the Western Frontier: Mormons, Miners, and Southern Paiutes</em> and the co-editor of <em>Mormonism: A Historical Encyclopedia</em> and <em>Between Pulpit and Pew: The Supernatural World in Mormon History</em> <em>and Folklore. </em><br><br>"a timely and provocative account [...] This study is a welcome contribution to a number of fields[...] Students of American religious history will also find much to learn from this study as it joins the growing body of literature that serves to blur distinctions between religious and racial othering and reveals the complex interplay between religion and race in American history." -- Kelsey Moss, Princeton University, <em>Journal of Ecclesiastical History</em><p></p><br>"Cleverly framed....Reeve's book is a landmark in Mormon studies. For non-Mormon and Mormon audiences alike, it offers answers to the long-vexing questions of the when, where, who, and why of the origins of what is colloquially called the 'priesthood ban.' And Reeve's book adds Mormons to the well-established historiography on how ethnic and cultural minorities in America became white. Reeve's book is now the definitive history on Mormonism and race."--Max Perry Mueller, <em>The Journal of Religion</em><p></p><br>"Overall, Reeve's book is a tremendous step forward in studies of Mormonism, race, and racialization, and indeed of race in American history more broadly. By examining a spectrum of groups, Reeve creates an unprecedentedly fleshed-out picture of these racial processes."--Alexandra Griffin, <em>Reading</em> <em>Religion</em><p></p><br>"Fascinating, deeply researched, intricately argued, and wonderfully illustrated. This will be the definitive work on race and Mormonism from the religion's origins to the early twentieth century, with a postscript carrying the story forward through the twentieth century down to Mitt Romney."--Paul Harvey, <em>Journal of the American Academy of Religion</em><p></p><br>"Reeve goes beyond the more traditional narrative of Mormons' views of racial minorities (especially blacks and Native Americans) to consider how those racial beliefs were constructed as a dialectic alongside the racialization of Mormons by non-LDS outsiders, particularly in the nineteenth century. In its sophisticated conversation with whiteness theory and the history of American race relations, Reeve's book is innovative and theoretically ambitious "--<em>BYU Studies Quarterly</em><p></p><br>"<em>Religion of a Different Color</em> should stand as an exceptional and transformative study of race and American religion. It is a rich and unique contribution to scholarship on Mormon religion that is equally a well-crafted study of race. It should certainly serve to inspire intellectually generative debate and further research on the constitution of racial whiteness for many years to come."--<em>Mormon Studies Review</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>Religion of a Different Color</em> is a true historical tour de force. It instantly joins the elite ranks of the Mormon studies canon, becoming required reading for anyone interested in the Mormon past (or present). The book's utility goes far beyond Mormon studies, however, as it should also be consulted by scholars of whiteness and American race relations as an expert analysis of how religion impacted and was impacted by the national discourse about race."--<em>BYU Studies Review</em> <br><p></p><br>"Reeve's book...will probably go down as one of the most important books in Mormon historiography."--<em>Juvenile Instructor</em><p></p><br>"In this revealing study, Paul Reeve puts the subject of Mormon racialization in a new light. Mormons racialized others, to be sure, but were in turn racialized themselves. In the nineteenth century critics denigrated Mormons by seeing them as racially a between-people, near-Black, friendly to Indians, and likely allies of the yellow hordes. The church's compensating rush to whiteness, unfortunately, went too far. Now Mormons are seen as too white, obscuring their innate inclination to universalism. No one has told this excruciating story so well as Reeve."--Richard Bushman, author of <em>Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling</em><p></p><br>"Compelling as a set of incredible, revealing stories as well as nuanced analysis, this study places Mormonism within varied worlds of race in a way unequalled by any denominational history of religion and white racism. Reeve's work represents a breakthrough in Mormon history, religious history, and history of the West, as well as in the study of race relations."--David Roediger, author of <em>Seizing Freedom: Slave Emancipation and Liberty for All</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>Religion of a Different Color</em> plows truly new and important ground in explaining the fuller story of Mormonism's place in the long American struggle with racial bigotry, as well as the uses of racialist thinking in U.S. history more generally. Previous studies have tried to explain the traditional racial teachings of Mormonism mainly by reference to doctrines and developments inside the Church. This new study instead analyzes the heavily racialized context of the entire nation, in which Mormons became both victims and perpetrators of racist policies and practices."--Armand L. Mauss, author of <em>All Abraham's Children: Changing Mormons Conceptions of Race and Lineage</em><p></p><br>"With prodigious research and a keen eye for detail, context, and irony, Paul Reeve masterfully guides us through the fickleness and combustibility of nineteenth-century American racial discourse, with Mormons as his unlikely subjects. In the process of fighting off swarms of accusations that they were not white enough, Mormons reified whiteness as the sine qua non of American respectability. <em>Religion of a Different Color</em> provides a powerful new lens that helps us better understand how and why race remains such a troubled legacy for both America and 'the American religion.'"--Patrick Q. Mason, Claremont Graduate University<p></p><br>"A widely researched, soundly documented, challenging addition to whiteness studies and to scholarly literature on race generally."--<em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"Thoroughly researched, clearly written, and surprising, Reeve's work is the new starting piece for discussions of Mormons and race."--<em>Western Historical Quarterly</em><p></p><br>"The argumentative thread is rich and complex; my summary here hardly captures the subtlety and detail of the discussion. Fortunately, Reeve has a gift for short, targeted sentences and summary paragraphs that make his major points with crystalline clarity. That knack for pinpoint summaries helps the reader navigate through a text full of quotation, illustration, and sometimes dense textual analysis of Mormon writings."--<em>The Journal of the American Academy of Religion</em><p></p><br>"In the shadow of Ferguson, Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Baltimore, and countless other recent racial controversies, W. Paul Reeve's book is a timely study of how humans racialize other humans and deny communities the right to construct their own identity. Its bold, fresh take far exceeds any minor quibbles I might try and summon in false pursuit of a balanced review. It is nothing short of marvelous, and it has my highest recommendation. It will shape how we think about Mormonism and racial identity for decades."--<em>Journal of Mormon History</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Peter Pan (Dover Children&#39;s Evergreen Classics)</h2><p>Peter Pan &#x2014; a little boy who doesn't want to grow up &#x2014; has run off to Never-Never Land where he becomes the leader of a wild tribe of Lost Boys.

After a quick lesson in flying, they're all off to Never-Never Land and one thrilling adventure after another.<br>Over the years, James M. Barrie's delightful tale, made even more familiar through Broadway plays, television, and motion pictures, has charmed generations of youngsters. This complete, unabridged edition promises to captivate countless new readers with its timeless appeal.</p><p>"All children, except one, grow up." Thus begins a great classic of children's literature that we all remember as magical. What we tend to forget, because the tale of Peter Pan and Neverland has been so relentlessly boiled down, hashed up, and coated in saccharine, is that J.M. Barrie's original version is also witty, sophisticated, and delightfully odd. The Darling children, Wendy, John, and Michael, live a very proper middle-class life in Edwardian London, but they also happen to have a Newfoundland for a nurse. The text is full of such throwaway gems as "Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter Pan when she was tidying up her children's minds," and is peppered with deliberately obscure vocabulary including "embonpoint," "quietus," and "pluperfect." Lest we forget, it was written in 1904, a relatively innocent age in which a plot about abducted children must have seemed more safely fanciful. Also, perhaps, it was an age that expected more of its children's books, for <i>Peter Pan</i> has a suppleness, lightness, and intelligence that are "literary" in the best sense. In a typical exchange with the dastardly Captain Hook, Peter Pan describes himself as "youth... joy... a little bird that has broken out of the egg," and the author interjects: "This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very pinnacle of good form." A book for adult readers-aloud to revel in--and it just might teach young listeners to fly.

She has illustrated numerous picture books for publishers in Italy, Japan, Spain, France, and the UK. Sophie is passionate about animals and enjoys painting them in her artwork. When she&#39;s not illustrating, Sophie often runs children&#39;s art workshops in schools and gets involved in exhibitions of her work.PreS-Gr 2-With a slight one-sentence-per-page narrative to guide readers, this bilingual word book chronicles the daily activities of the Familia Palabra and the laudably diverse residents in their community. This story is virtually identical to Fatus's My Barefoot Book of Wonderful Words (Barefoot Bks., 2014) with the exception of some minor changes and the addition of Spanish vocabulary. In this incarnation, Zanzibar the cat becomes Paco and Crunchy the croc morphs into Fresco. The bright, whimsical illustrations are the same, though a few of the individual characters have been repurposed. For example, the paperboy from Wonderful Words becomes the bike messenger in this title. In addition, items identified in the previous edition are unlabeled here-the book in braille and the origami projects depicted in the library scene. Some of the Spanish terms are not as common in Latin America as in the case of cesta de picnic being used instead of the more familiar canasta de picnic. But what makes this, and other similar word-building books, less than ideal is the fact that phonetic spellings are not included to facilitate the acquisition of a bilingual vocabulary. A monolingual English-speaking child will see the word alcantarilla (defined as "manhole" in the text, but is actually a storm drain) and probably anglicize it-al-can-ta-ril-la-instead of using the correct pronunciation: ahl-cahn-tah-REE-yah. A monolingual Spanish-speaking child would conversely see manhole and try pronouncing it mahn-hoh-leh. VERDICT When employed in conjunction with competent bilingual teachers, this book can enrich language lessons and help promote multicultural diversity awareness.-Mary Margaret Mercado, Pima County Public Library, Tucson, AZ&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

Plantagenet Ancestry of Seventeenth-Century Colonists is the first of this new generation of books. Prepared by David Faris, who had assisted Mr. Sheppard with the last two editions of Ancestral Roots, Plantagenet Ancestry provides the descent from the later Plantagenet kings of England (Henry III, Edward I, Edward II, and Edward III) of more than one hundred emigrants from England and Wales to the North American colonies before 1701, including many colonists not included in former editions of Ancestral Roots. All 137 lines in this new volume include the consecutive generations of married couples with the spouse of Plantagenet descent on the left margin, each such individual being the child of the previous generation. Generation 1 names the parents of an emigrant, and the preceding generations are numbered back in time to the Plantagenet kings. Considerable biographical information is provided together with documentation for each generation.</p><p></p><h2>An Introduction To Traditional Logic: Classical Reasoning For Contemporary Minds</h2><p>A textbook for high school and university students on traditional logic.</p><p></p><h2>An African American and Latinx History of the United States (REVISIONING HISTORY)</h2><p><b>An intersectional history of the shared struggle for African American and Latinx civil rights</b><br><br>Spanning more than two hundred years, <i>An African American and Latinx History of the United States</i> is a revolutionary, politically charged narrative history, arguing that the &#x201c;Global South&#x201d; was crucial to the development of America as we know it.

She is an accomplished licensed psychotherapist in private practice. She has over 15 years of clinical experience treating clients with an array of health disorders including Asperger's, depression, anxiety, OCD and ADHD."Last year, I had the honor of reviewing&nbsp;Marcia Hind&#x2019;s book,&nbsp;I know You&#x2019;re in There.&nbsp; Since then, Marcia and I have talked frequently on Facebook.&nbsp; We share a common bond that most of us autism moms share.&nbsp; It&#x2019;s easy to find that support in one another when you are living similar journeys.&nbsp; One day, while talking with Marcia, she recommended I review another book.&nbsp; Ironically, the book she recommended,&nbsp;<i>Healing Without Hurting,&nbsp;</i>by Jennifer Giustra-Kozek, LPC, NNC, was already on my Amazon order.<br> Jennifer&#x2019;s book is about treating ADHD, autism, apraxia, and the like using a natural approach versus medication.&nbsp; Jennifer is a psychotherapist who wrote her book based on years of experience treating patients with ADD, ADHD, autism, OCD and other diagnoses, in addition to the journey of her own son Evan, born in 2006.<br> As a psychotherapist, Jennifer has firsthand knowledge that she shares with us of the negative effects that medications can have on some children.&nbsp; Because of those negative effects, she wanted to explore all other available option for both her patients and her own child.&nbsp; Thus began her journey to find healing without hurting.<br> The first three chapters of the book recount Evan&#x2019;s birth and the five and a half weeks he spent in the NICU as a preemie.&nbsp; Jennifer writes poignantly about the many illnesses Evan had as a baby.&nbsp; As I read through those pages, I thought of our TMR red flag blog series.&nbsp; Evan had red flag after red flag, including chronic ear infections, bronchitis, sinus infections, fungal infections and sleep issues.&nbsp; In addition to the medical red flags, Jennifer writes about the behavioral red flags that also began popping up.&nbsp; Like so many of us, she worried about her child and wondered what could possibly be going on with her son.<br> Chapters 4 and 5 detail Jennifer and Evan&#x2019;s journey to diagnosis:&nbsp;moderate to severe apraxia, pervasive development disorder, ADHD and sensory processing disorder. &nbsp;It also discusses the many co-morbid conditions that frequently accompany the neurological diagnoses.<br> Chapter 6 outlines commonly used medications. As a psychotherapist, Jennifer has been working with clients on stimulant drugs for approximately 15 years now. However, when Evan received his diagnosis, she found herself in a professional/personal struggle. All that she had encountered in her professional world, told her that &#x2018;non-medicated&#x2019; children faced additional risks if their needs were not addressed. The mother in her struggled with what she had been taught professionally. She did not want to medicate Evan. Her maternal instincts kicked in, and she was determined to listen to them, alternatively finding other treatment for Evan, all the while feeling that although medication may be necessary down the road, she needed to exhaust more natural options for treatment first. Within this chapter, she discusses a number of frequently prescribed medications and what these medications are intended to do when prescribed to treat ADD, ADHD, aggression, anxiety, OCD, etc. She includes information on MedWatch which was created by the FDA to alert consumers of potential side effects of medication.<br> Chapter 7 describes the road to alternative treatments.&nbsp; Many of us have chosen this road. &nbsp;Understandably, many of us want to exhaust all other possible avenues before having to put our five-year-olds on medication for sleep issues and/or aggressive behaviors &#x2013; often &#x2018;for life.&#x2019;&nbsp; Jennifer&#x2019;s book discusses other possibilities.<br> Chapter 8 explores possible genetic mutations that may be underlying our children&#x2019;s conditions and explains to find out if your child has one or MTHFR gene mutations.&nbsp; Healthy gut flora, vaccines, excessive ultrasounds, viruses and bacterial infections are all discussed within the pages of chapters 9 and 10. General anesthesia can be a trigger for many of our kids. Jennifer discusses Evan&#x2019;s history of going under anesthesia many times by the age of four and the possible contribution that had on his developing immune system. She goes on to further discuss how NAET (Nambudripad&#x2019;s Allergy Elimination Technique) helped to determine Evan had developed a sensitivity to the anesthesia that needed to be addressed.<br> Chapters 11 and 12 discuss the all-important gut-brain connection and the malabsorption problems.&nbsp; Research has shown that gut issues are widespread in children with the &#x2018;psychological&#x2019; diagnoses of autism, ADHD, OCD, etc. Jennifer goes into detail, describing numerous nutritional supplements and what their roles are in supporting our children&#x2019;s bodies.<br> Chapters 13 and 14 discuss Evan&#x2019;s personal journey with alternative protocols. &nbsp;Chapters 15-18 cover topics that are important for every family with a child with ADD, ADHD and/or autism: food sensitivities, processed foods, and GMOs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jennifer provides a detailed checklist for possible signs of gluten and dairy sensitivities. &nbsp;I cannot stress enough the importance of &nbsp;these chapters.&nbsp; Understanding the effect that food has on our children&#x2019;s health, what food sensitivities are and what they can do to our bodies, and understanding how to eliminate those sensitivities can be crucial for restoring the health of our children.<br> The more I read, the more excited I got about the chapter titles.&nbsp; I remember thinking to myself,&nbsp;<i>WOW, Jennifer managed to get it all into her book.</i><br> Chapters 19 and 20 discuss neurotoxins, heavy metals and neurotransmitters.&nbsp; Neurotransmitters are important to understand because they tell us why our kids go into the fight or flight response.&nbsp; If your child has aggression issues or emotional outbursts, read these chapters.<br> Chapters 21-23 discuss the use of supplements and non-traditional therapies such as neurofeedback, chiropractic care, horseback riding (hippotherapy), and even essential oils!&nbsp; There are so many options to choose from when navigating through the alternative route of care.&nbsp; So many of us have done traditional therapies in addition to different modalities for healing our kids." &#x2014;&nbsp;Thinking Moms' Revolution, thinkingmomsrevolution.com<br><br><p>"At 4 � years old, my sweet and loving son Evan was diagnosed with ADHD, Apraxia and high functioning autism &#x2013; Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD). Although mostly happy, he started displaying episodes of anger and become anxious and obsessive/compulsive (OCD). He began fixating on many things and lost the ability to sleep soundly.<br> I often felt hopeless and frustrated with the progress of his recovery during our intense therapy sessions and I knew from experience as a licensed psychotherapist that medication would be introduced as the only other viable treatment option.<br> I recognized that medication may provide immediate relief, but because I am a psychotherapist also knew that these medications can cause many problems and come with numerous side effects. In some cases they even cause increased anger, depression, fogginess, anxiety, numbness, seizures, tics, paranoia and even psychosis.<br> I witnessed many of these effects on the children I saw for therapy. Some moms came back to tell me that it turned their child into someone they did not recognize. However, I never really questioned the authority of the medical professionals.<br> 'Who was I to question a doctor that had many more years of experience and schooling to back their theories?' I thought...<br> As life would have it, all the training and education I received in graduate school and by prestigious psychiatrists about the benefits of medication would be challenged when I had my own child with similar symptoms.<br> I have discovered that although well intentioned, many mainstream doctors are too quick to prescribe medication to cover up symptoms without digging deeper to find the underlying causes and numerous nutritional deficiencies plaguing our kids.<br> Our children become out of balance (biochemically). Their immune systems go haywire and their guts become inflamed due to food intolerances, processed foods, food dyes, chemicals, GMOs, yeast, etc. This often can cause inflammation in the brain and nutritional deficiencies &#x2013; leading to frequent illness (chronic ear infections, illness, bronchitis &amp; asthma) and ultimately neurological dysfunction.<br> I discovered that we have more neurons lining our intestinal wall than we have in our brain and spinal cord combined. The gut and brain have a very intimate relationship. So, when the gut isn&#x2019;t happy, neither is the brain. I have also uncovered a few gene mutations preventing the proper utilization and metabolic functioning of essential nutrients necessary for proper brain functioning. These disorders are often linked to constipation, food allergies &amp; sensitivities, heavy metal build-up, adrenal fatigue, thyroid problems and hypoglycemia.<br> I was extremely skeptical at first.<br> However, as I started doing a tremendous amount of research, I became to uncover the root causes of these disorders. I started addressing Evan&#x2019;s gut issues with the help of an awesome naturopath and other functional medicine doctors and began healing him from a deeper level.<br> We started by&nbsp;<b>healing his gut wall</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>eliminating all of his offending foods</b>&nbsp;and reducing inflammation and gut permeability so that the nutrients he was eating and the supplements we were giving him would get absorbed properly.<br> We continued treating Evan with&nbsp;<b>nutrition and biomedical methods</b>. We starting taking advantage of the many Eastern Medicine therapies and treatments such as acupuncture, and energy healing, as well. I discovered that over the course of treatment&nbsp;<b>Evan started improving exponentially</b>&nbsp;in all areas of development, including, emotionally, socially, physically and academically.<br> I highly recommend that this &#x2018;avenue of healing&#x2019; be explored if your child suffers from ADD/ADHD, PDD, Asperger&#x2019;s, Allergies, Apraxia or Autism.<br> An improving Evan (in his Boy Scouts uniform) and his father.<br><b>The Differences We Began To See</b><br> When Evan was tested at age 5 � his level of development was only that of a 3 � year-old. Developmentally he was two years behind his peers. However a year later after implementing the alternative treatments Evan&#x2019;s testing demonstrated a huge improvement in all areas of development. His testing showed a dramatic increase in progress. At 6 � his level of development was that of a 5 � year-old. Now he was only one year behind his peers.<br> There is a tremendous jump in Evan&#x2019;s expressive language and speech articulation; it is more complex and conversational. His comprehension skills are also much better. He is able to formulate a thought and carry out his set of plans. He is now formulating new ideas and trying them out on others.<br> Evan&#x2019;s true personality started to emerge and it was discovered that he has a very dry but funny sense of humor. One day while Evan&#x2019;s grandma was cooking a new stew recipe that included cinnamon her &#x2018;special ingredient&#x2019; she hit her wooden spoon against the pot and a piece of the spoon flew off. She warned us all to watch out for it because she had no idea where it flew. After dinner, grandma asked if anyone could taste what the special ingredient was and without hesitation Evan said, &#x2018;Spoon.&#x2019;<br> After&nbsp;<b>putting the alternative treatments into practice</b>&nbsp;and addressing underlying nutritional deficiencies,&nbsp;<b>Evan&#x2019;s progress catapulted</b>. He was able to stay on task and presented less careless. He has less difficulty listening and following directions, and no longer seemed to get as distracted by background noise. He listens to his teachers and responds appropriately when asked a question. He is able to retain information and speaks more clearly to convey his ideas.<br> Socially he is also doing much better. He is making eye contact more often and now greets his friends at the playground. He no longer enters into a trance-like state. He no longer detaches himself from the world. Evan talks to strangers in waiting rooms and has whole conversations. He is able to assert himself and tell people what he likes and doesn&#x2019;t like and what he wants and doesn&#x2019;t want.<br> He is less anxious and no longer grunts and screams when he is upset. He is coping better with change of routine and with frustrating situations. He is no longer throwing himself into fits of uncontrollable rage, throwing his toys, hitting others or displaying sudden mood swings. In addition, his sensory issues are lessening greatly. Loud noises and uncomfortable clothing no longer bother him.<br> His pre-kintergarten treatment plan included a communication device to help Evan to write and communicate. However, he lost his need for such a device. His fine motor skills have significantly improved and he is able to write his letters as well as many of his peers. He is also able to communicate clearly and express his thoughts and ideas in a sequential way.<br> We now see a confident little boy who is eager to join in group activities. His motor planning ability has jumped up from extremely disordered to barely noticeable. We notice an increase in imaginative play and although not perfect, there is a greater independence in daily activities of living.<br> On Evan&#x2019;s seventh birthday, his grandfather was joking around with him by saying, &#x2018;Mmm your cake looks so good &#x2013; I think I&#x2019;m going to eat your piece.&#x2019;<br> In the same breath without skipping a beat, Evan replied, &#x2018;That&#x2019;s okay grandpa, I&#x2019;ll just eat yours.&#x2019;<br> Demonstrating a marked improvement is social ability, an increased self-esteem and tremendous growth on so many levels.<br> He got the joke, stood up for himself, responded with amazing wit, and delivered it in such a loving and non-aggressive way.<br> We are so proud of him in so many ways...<br> Medically we notice that his sweet cravings lessened and he was no longer overly thirsty. The dark bluish circles under his eyes disappeared. His eczema and fungal infections cleared. He has not been sick except for a few minor colds and has only missed a few days of school since starting the regime. He no longer suffers from sinus infections, respiratory infections, or eye infections. His constipation issues continue to improve, he is no longer straining and his bowels appear less sluggish. He no longer suffers from nightly head sweats and the quality of has sleep has improved as well.<br> Teachers, therapists, his swimming instructor and family members have all made comments on how well Evan is doing. They say, &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know what you are doing, but whatever you are doing we see a huge difference in Evan, so keep it up.&#x2019;<br> Evan is now 8 years old and progressing well. When I recently asked him, &#x2018;What do you think helped you more &#x2013; all the intense therapy or your diet changes and vitamins?&#x2019;<br> He looked at me with the biggest smile and with huge inflection in his voice and said, &#x2018;Mom, they helped each other work better.&#x2019; So we continue with appointments with the homeopathic physician to address any emerging health concerns or imbalances. And we continue his dietary modifications for now and we continue with his therapies in order for him to catch up 100%, in an effort to optimize his health.<br> A happy Evan and his sister Elaina.<br><b>8 ...</b></p></p><h2>Think Wrong: How to Conquer the Status Quo and Do Work That Matters</h2><p><b>The way we solve problems is broken.

However, it is rarely presented as a comprehensive panorama because scholars tend to divide it into distinct eras&#x2014;prehistoric, pharaonic, Greco-Roman, Coptic, medieval Islamic, Ottoman, and modern&#x2014;that are not often studied in relation to one another. In this daringly ambitious project, drawing on the most current scholarship as well as his own research, Thompson makes the case that few if any other countries have as many threads of continuity running through their entire historical experience. With its unprecedented scope and lively and readable style, <b>A History of Egypt</b><i> </i>offers students, travelers, and general readers alike an engaging narrative of the extraordinarily long course of human history by the Nile.&nbsp;</p><p>Jason Thompson is a professor of Middle Eastern Studies at Colby College.THE GIFT OF THE NILE<br><br>Egypt is readily recognizable on the map today as an angular wedge of northeastern Africa and a chunk of southwestern Asia. It covers slightly more than a million square kilometers, and at the beginning of the twenty-first century it was inhabited by approximately seventy-five million people. The capital of Egypt, Cairo, with its population of more than sixteen million, is the largest city on the African continent. <br><br>But to envision Egypt historically, and to understand its geographical essence, one must think first about the Nile, the longest river in the world, and a river that flows through the Sahara, the largest desert in the world. When the Greek traveler Herodotus described Egypt as the gift of the Nile in the fifth century BC, he was probably just repeating what was already a well-worn phrase, but one true since long before historical memory and no less so now. Rainfall is insignificant in the valley of the Nile, and not abundant in the Delta, so that virtually all of Egypt's water comes from the Nile, and even with the amazing development during the past few decades of the Mediterranean and Red Sea coasts, 95 percent of the population of Egypt still live within a few miles of the river. Almost all of Egypt's arable land, about 34,000 square kilometers, lies in the river valley and the Delta. <br><br>The Egyptian Nile has three major sources. The longest is the White Nile. The sources of this river, until the mid-nineteenth century one of the world's great geographical mysteries, lie deep within Africa, especially in the lake region, where Lake Victoria in Uganda and Tanzania makes the largest contribution. As it flows for more than 6,400 kilometers to the Mediterranean, the White Nile passes through ten modern nations amid changing geography. In southern Sudan, it becomes mired in the Sudd, a vast swamp that slows it and causes heavy water loss through evaporation, although the Sudd also mediates the river's flow, releasing it over a longer period of time. Because of the Sudd and the fact that Lake Victoria's catchment area is fed by rainfall throughout the year, the Egyptian Nile's flow never fails entirely. <br><br>The other main sources of the Egyptian Nile are the Blue Nile, which joins the White Nile in Sudan at Khartoum, and the Atbara, which flows into the Nile farther north in Sudan. They account for the annual inundation of the Nile, the central geographical feature of Egyptian history. Their tributaries are rooted in the Ethiopian highlands, where the summer monsoon dumps vast amounts of water that runs off quickly, laden with silt and clay washed away from Ethiopia's volcanic mountains. Although popular imagination tends to associate the sources of the Nile with the White Nile and the lake region of central Africa, 84 percent of the river's water that reaches Egypt comes from Ethiopia. <br><br>In perfect harmony with the solar year, the Nile began to rise in Egypt at the midsummer solstice and peaked at the autumnal equinox, rising from a low of less than fifty million cubic meters per day in early June to over seven hundred at the inundation's height in September. When the swollen river reached the broad flood plains of Egypt, it spilled over its banks, soaking the rich alluvial soil and washing away the harmful salts that were the long-term bane of other ancient hydraulic civilizations such as Mesopotamia. As it receded, the river left behind pools of water and a fine layer of sediments and minerals. The drying earth would crack open, aerating the soil and thus completing the cycle of renewal. The shift to the past tense is because the construction of the Aswan High Dam ended the inundations in Egypt during the 1960s. <br><br>The inundation was the pulsing life force of Egypt. Everything depended on it--and that it be at the correct level. If the inundation was too low, or if it failed entirely, the fields could not be irrigated adequately. A succession of low Niles was catastrophic, causing not only famine but also extreme general economic and political dislocation. But too high an inundation was even worse because it flooded and destroyed the homes that were built on mounds above the expected rise of the water, damaged or destroyed irrigation dams and sluices, and left the water on the land beyond the planting season. <br><br>The peculiar rhythms of the Nile created an unusual agricultural cycle in Egypt. Most rivers swell to their fullest in the spring then diminish as the weather grows warmer, but the Nile rose and crested during the summer, at precisely the hottest time of the year. Crops were sown in the fall and ripened through the winter. Harvest came in early spring; then the land was allowed to lie fallow a few weeks until the inundation again spread across it. Coming as it did at the end of June, the flood spared crops from exposure to scorching heat and people from the necessity of laboring in it. The ancient Egyptians recognized three seasons: inundation, seed-time, and harvest. <br><br>The Nile is continuously navigable for the nine hundred kilometers between the First Cataract at Aswan and the Delta, a fact that was of fundamental importance for Egypt's unification and continuing prosperity. The river is ideal for sailing vessels. Going north, they are propelled by the steady current; and, because the prevailing winds are from the northwest, boats can usually sail south up the river. If the wind fails, the crews can tow their boats from the paths along the bank. One can still get a lively sense of sail navigation on the Nile by riding on one of the ubiquitous feluccas, whose elegant triangular sails are to be seen all along the river. The Egyptians relied heavily on the Nile and continue to do so today. It was the main avenue for long-distance communication, commerce, and transportation. The Nile provided a way to move very large, heavy objects like building stone over long distances, then the annual inundation could bring the barge right next to the building site. One reason ancient Egypt was relatively late in using wheeled vehicles was lack of roads; space for roads had to come out of the limited amount of fertile land, so they were kept short and narrow. Who needed long-distance highways when the river ran the length of Egypt and was within a few kilometers of almost everyone? <br><br>A short distance north of Cairo, the Nile fans out into a wide delta. Today the river has two main channels through the Delta, the Rosetta and the Damietta; in ancient times there were seven. The Delta is Lower Egypt, Upper Egypt being the stretch of the Nile between the Delta and the First Cataract at Aswan. The distinction between Lower and Upper is determined by the fact that the river flows from south to north, not which area is higher on the map. This point is emphasized because people commonly get it backwards, thinking wrongly that Upper Egypt must be in the north and Lower Egypt in the south. Strictly speaking, it is still correct for someone traveling south from Cairo to Luxor or Aswan to say that they are "going up" to those places, although few do so today. The Delta, with twice as much arable land as Upper Egypt, was exceedingly important in early Egyptian history, but much of its material record has been concealed or obliterated by the waterlogged nature of the land, which usually makes Deltan archaeology exceedingly difficult, thereby biasing available evidence toward Upper Egypt, where conditions of preservation and access are much better. <br><br>The rocky nature of the river valley has determined the geography of Upper Egypt. After a stretch from Aswan north to Gebel al-Silsileh, where hard Nubian sandstone predominates and constricts the valley, the Nile enters a long region of softer limestone, which allowed the river to form a much wider floodplain that is highly suitable for agriculture. Between the great Qena Bend and Cairo, the hills and mountains on the west bank subside, allowing the fertile floodplain on that side of the river to become wider still while the mountains on the east push close to the river, restricting agriculture and sometimes precluding it altogether on the eastern side. This portion of Upper Egypt is sometimes referred to as Middle Egypt. <br><br>Although the border of the modern nation of Egypt lies much farther south, the land of Egypt, properly speaking, ends at the First Cataract, just above (south of) the town of Aswan. Altogether there are six of these cataracts between Aswan and the confluence of the White and Blue Niles at Khartoum. These are not so much cataracts in the dictionary sense of the word, which implies a waterfall, as they are rapids, and so they are called in Arabic. The First Cataract was formed by a band of uplifted granite bedrock and boulders that divided the Nile's waters into numerous fast-running rivulets, and that made Aswan an important source of granite. Ancient quarry marks and inscriptions still appear sharp and clear on the durable stone in the channels at Aswan. Boats could be passed through the First Cataract, but only with difficulty, so it was a barrier to navigation and became something of a cultural and political barrier as well. The First Cataract was partially obliterated by the Aswan Dam at the beginning of the twentieth century, and the Second Cataract was submerged by the waters of Lake Nasser in the middle of the century. <br><br>Nubia lies to the south of the First Cataract. Egyptian Nubia, or Lower Nubia (as in Egypt, Lower is in the north and Upper in the south), was the northern stretch of Nubia between the First Cataract and the Second Cataract at Wadi Halfa. Until it was obliterated by the waters of Lake Nasser, created by the construction of the Aswan High Dam during the 1960s, Lower Nubia was a distinct cultural and geographical area, and often politically distinct as well. The Nubians spoke different languages from ancient Egyptian and, later, from Arabic. The fate of their land vis-�-vis Egypt was heavily determined by geography, for unlike the river valley in most of Egypt, where soft limestone and other factors permitted the river to spread across a wide, fertile floodplain, Nubia was covered with much harder sandstone that allowed the river to cut only a narrow trench through it. The mountains often slanted right down into the water, resulting in steep banks along which only a slender band of cultivation was possible, and sometimes none at all. This meant that Nubia could never support a population comparable in size to Egypt's, nor could it produce the vast agricultural surplus that was the economic basis of Egyptian civilization. <br><br>A view of the Nile Valley from the air is unforgettable: a band of intense green running through a desolate desert. The contrast can also be striking on the ground, where one can literally stand with one foot in fertile fields and the other on barren sand. The band of cultivation is usually quite distinct, so that the ancient Egyptians spoke of the Black Land (kemet), because of the rich mud deposited over the millennia by the annual inundation and the Red Land (deret), the desert beyond the inundation's reach. <br><br>The Eastern Desert of Egypt lies between the Nile and the Red Sea. Its most significant feature is the Red Sea mountain range, which runs north-south along most of its length. The Eastern Desert's craggy peaks, resulting from both uplift and erosion, constitute some of the most memorable scenery on earth. The range is cut with numerous wadis, dry stream beds that mostly run east-west to drain into the Red Sea or the Nile. Although rain is rare in the Eastern Desert, when it comes the wadis can turn into raging torrents. Some wadis, such as the large Wadi Qena, were formed by ancient rivers. The steep walls and alluvial beds of wadis form natural passages through the difficult terrain. Of these, one of the most significant is Wadi Hammamat, which provides a line of communication between Qift on the Nile and Quseir on the Red Sea. An important source for stone and certain precious metals, the Eastern Desert has been quarried and mined since ancient times. The area has long been inhabited by Bedouin peoples, but the coastal strip began to experience intensive development in the late twentieth century. <br><br>The geography of the Western Desert, or Libyan Desert, is more varied, and it is much larger, covering two-thirds of Egypt, the entire area between the Nile and the Libyan border. Much of it consists of rocky outcrops and sandy or stony wastes. On the west is the Great Sand Sea, and the southwest is dominated by a high plateau, the Gilf al-Kebir. The Western Desert features a number of large depressions, including the enormous Qattara Depression, which descends to 133 meters beneath sea level at its lowest point. This desert also contains several fertile oases, including Siwa in the north and the Inner Oases: Bahariya, Farafra, Dakhla, and Kharga. By far the largest is Dakhla. Continuously inhabited since the Paleolithic, or Old Stone Age, Dakhla Oasis is an archaeological site of exceptional importance. <br><br>One of the depressions in the Western Desert is the area known as the Fayyum. Though often described as an oasis, it is closely connected to the Nile system and derives all its water directly from the nearby river through the Hawara Channel, a small opening in the escarpment on the western valley. The Fayyum is phenomenally fertile, its productivity enhanced by a complex system of irrigation so that water flows into it from the Nile then spreads out through ever smaller channels descending along the gentle southern slope of the depression until it reaches a large lake, Birket Qarun. The size of this lake has fluctuated greatly since the Old Kingdom with increased control over the influx of water; presently its surface is about forty-five meters below sea level. The north side of Birket Qarun is bounded by steeper infertile slopes. Sometimes a map of Egypt is likened to a lotus plant: the Nile is the plant's long stem, the Delta its flower, and the Fayyum a leaf. <br><br>The Sinai Peninsula is composed of a mountainous plateau in the south that drops sharply into the Gulf of Aqaba on the southeast and less precipitously into the Gulf of Suez on the southwest. Like the Eastern Desert, this part of the peninsula has long been a source of materials such as copper and turquoise. Northern Sinai is a wide coastal plain that provides a corridor of contact between Egypt and southwestern Asia, though one somewhat inhibited by its desert nature. <br><br>The two seacoasts of Egypt are the Mediterranean on the north and the Red Sea on the east. Although the Mediterranean coast receives slightly more rainfall than the rest of Egypt, it has historically been an area of low-density population, but it has recently been subjected to heavy development along most of its extent. It has no natural harbors, and there were no ports until the establishment of Alexandria, nor did the geography of the Delta lend itself to communication with the sea.</p><h2>The Cyclops Witch and the Heebie-Jeebies</h2><p><p>The Cyclops Witch never backs down from adventure or the medley of monsters she meets along the way.

What are these things and what do they have to do with Warren Buffett? The answer is everything.<br><br>If the vast majority of the stock market were not short-sighted, Warren Buffett would never have an opportunity to buy some of the world's greatest businesses at discount prices. He could never have bought 1.7 million shares of <i>The Washington Post</i> twenty-seven years ago for approximately $6.14 a share. <i>The Washington Post</i> now trades at approximately $500 a share, which makes his $10.2 million initial investment worth approximately $863.8 million today. That equates to a pretax annual compounding rate of return of 17.8%. Without the short-sightedness of the stock market, Warren could not have bought Coca-Cola for $5.22 a share twelve years ago. It now trades at approximately $50 a share, which equates to a pretax <i>annual</i> compounding rate of return of approximately 21%.<br><br>Warren discovered early on in his career that 95% of the participants in the stock market, from Internet day traders to mutual fund managers who manage billions, are only interested in making a quick buck. Yes, some pay lip service to the importance of long-term investing, but in truth they are stuck on making fast money.<br><br>Warren found that no matter how intelligent a person is, the nature of the beast controls the investor's actions. Take mutual fund managers. If you talk to any of them, they will tell you that they are under great pressure to produce the highest yearly results possible. This is because mutual funds are marketed to a lay public that is only interested in investing in funds that earn top performance ratings in any given year. Imagine a mutual fund manager telling his or her marketing team that their fund ranked in the bottom 10% for performance out of all the mutual funds in America. Do you think the marketing team would jump up and down with joy and go out and drop a couple of million on advertising to let the world know that their fund ranked in the bottom 10%? No. More likely our underperforming fund manager would lose his or her job and some promising young hot shot would take over the fund's investment allocations.<br><br>Don't believe it? Ask people you know why they chose to invest in a particular mutual fund and they will more than likely tell you it was because the fund was ranked as a top performer. The nature of the mutual fund beast influences a lot of very smart people into playing a short-term game with enormous amounts of capital. No matter what fund managers' personal convictions may be, producing the best short-term results possible is the way to keep their job.<br><br>Warren also discovered that investors who get caught up playing a short-term game have very human reactions whenever they hear bad news about a company in which they own shares -- they sell them. To make the big bucks in the short-term game, the investor has to be one of the first to get in on the stock before it moves up, and one of first to get out before it moves down. Having access to the most up-to-date information available is of utmost importance. A good earnings report and the stock price moves upward. A bad earnings report and it moves downward. It doesn't matter whether earnings will improve in a year or two. All that anybody is interested in is what is going to happen today. If things look great this week, people will buy the stock, and if they look bad next week, they will sell it. This is why mutual funds are notorious for having such high rates of investment turnover. They get in and out of a lot of different stocks in hopes of beating the other guys in the competition for the all-important title Top Fund of the Year.<br><br>This "bad news phenomenon" -- the selling of shares on bad news -- is one constant in the ever-changing world of stock market trading. Watch any nightly business report on television and you'll see that after any negative news about a company is announced, the price of its shares drops. If the news is really bad, the shares will drop like a rock. It's the nature of the beast.<br><br>Bad news means falling share prices; bad news means that Warren's eyes light up. To Warren, the short-sightedness of the stock market, when combined with the bad news phenomenon, is the gift that keeps on giving. This combination of factors has produced for him one great buying opportunity after another, year after year, decade after decade, to the happy tune of $30 billion.<br><br>Before we jump to the next chapter, we'll let you in on one of Warren's best-kept secrets. He figured out that some, but not all, companies have economic engines that are so powerful they can pull themselves out of almost any kind of bad news mud that the short-sightedness of the stock market gets them stuck in. He has developed a specific list of criteria to help him identify those businesses. When these businesses are hit with bad news and the short-sighted stock market hammers their stock prices, he steps in and buys like crazy. He calls these wonderfully resilient businesses "consumer monopolies." Warren made all his big money by investing in consumer monopolies. They are the Holy Grail of his investment philosophy and we predict that they will be the next great love of your investment life as well.<br><br><b>KEY POINTS<br><br>FROM THIS CHAPTER<br><br></b><ul><b><br> <li>Warren discovered that everyone from mutual fund managers to Internet day traders are stuck playing the short-term game.

The object of this unprecedented speculation was the tulip, a delicate and exotic Eastern import that had bewitched horticulturists, noblemen, and tavern owners alike. For almost a year rare bulbs changed hands for incredible and ever-increasing sums, until single flowers were being sold for more than the cost of a house. Historians would come to call it tulipomania. It was the first futures market in history, and like so many of the ones that would follow, it crashed spectacularly, plunging speculators and investors into economic ruin and despair.&nbsp;This colorful cast of characters includes Turkish sultans, Yugoslav soldiers, French botanists, and Dutch tavern keepers&#x2014;all centuries apart historically and worlds apart culturally, but with one thing in common: tulipomania.</p><p>For history buffs or gardeners who enjoy more than just digging in the dirt, <i>Tulipomania</i> presents a fascinating look at the tulip frenzy that took place in Holland in the mid-1600s. Beginning as gifts given among the wealthy and educated folk of Europe and Asia, the tulip rapidly became a source of incredible financial gain--similar to today's Internet start-up companies or Beanie Baby collections. Stories of craftsmen discontinuing their trade and focusing on raising tulips for public auction, where they sold for prices comparable to that of a manor house, are astonishing. Poets, moralists, businessmen--it seems everyone was involved at some level. <p> Lack of regulation and poor quality control were just a couple of the details that led to the abrupt crash in February 1637. Tulipomania was the original market bust--people were ruined, debts went unpaid. It was a disaster similar to the stock-market crash of 1929. A brief resurrection of the mania occurred 65 years later in Istanbul, and while it was not the financial obsession Holland experienced, it led to the creation of standards in flower shape and increased the development of new types. You don't need to be obsessed to enjoy this book--an interest in tulips, history, and the futures market ensures that this will be a remarkable read. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p>In the 1630s, visitors to the prosperous trading cities of the Netherlands couldn't help but notice that thousands of normally sober, hardworking Dutch citizens from every walk of life were caught up in an extraordinary frenzy of buying and selling.

For almost a year rare bulbs changed hands for incredible and ever-increasing sums, until single flowers were being sold for more than the cost of a house. <br>Historians would come to call it tulipomania. It was the first futures market in history, and like so many of the ones that would follow, it crashed spectacularly, plunging speculators and investors into economic ruin and despair. <br>This is the history of the tulip, from its origins on the barren, windswept steppes of central Asia to its place of honor in the lush imperial gardens of Constantinople, to its starring moment as the most coveted--and beautiful--commodity in Europe. Historian Mike Dash vividly narrates the story of this amazing flower and the colorful cast of characters--Turkish sultans, Yugoslav soldiers, French botanists, and Dutch tavern keepers--who were centuries apart historically and worlds apart culturally, but who all had one thing in common: tulipomania.</p><h2>Brigid and the Butter: A Legend about St</h2><p>Brigid wants to feed the hungry, but she is often hungry herself.

While some see retirement as a chance to cash in their chips and settle into a comfy armchair, Ollivier still longed for more. Searching for inspiration, he strapped on his gear, donned his hat, and headed out the front door to hike the Way of St. James, a 1400-mile journey from Paris to Compostela, Spain. At the end of that road, with more questions than answers, he decided to spend the next few years hiking another of history&#x2019;s great routes: the Silk Road.<br><br><i>Out of Istanbul</i> is Ollivier&#x2019;s stunning account of the first part of that 7,200-mile journey. The longest and perhaps most mythical trade route of all time, the Silk Road is in fact a network of routes across Europe and Asia, some going back to prehistoric times. During the Middle Ages, the transcribed travelogue of one Silk Road explorer, Marco Polo, helped spread the fame of the Orient throughout Europe.<br><br>Heading east out of Istanbul, Ollivier takes readers step by step across Anatolia and Kurdistan, bound for Tehran. Along the way, we meet a colorful array of real-life characters: Selim, the philosophical woodsman; old Beh�et, elated to practice English after years of self-study; Krishna, manager of the Lora Pansiyon in Polonez, a village of Polish immigrants; the hospitable Kurdish women of Dogutepe, and many more. We accompany Ollivier as he explores bazaars, mosques, and caravansaries&#x2014;true vestiges of the Silk Road itself&#x2014;and through these encounters and experiences, gains insight into the complex political and social issues facing modern-day Turkey.<br><br>Ollivier&#x2019;s journey, far from bragging about some tremendous achievement, humbly takes the reader on a colossal adventure of human proportions, one in which walking itself, through a kind of alchemy, fosters friendships and fellowship.</p><p>Career journalist turned traveler, <b>Bernard Ollivier</b> believes that walking has the power to transform.

He realized it was this time in his life that had a direct influence on his sensibilities, his humor, his writing, and ultimately a career searching the world for other such untamed creatures for the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, the <i>New York Times</i>, and <i>CBS News</i>.<br><br> In <i>Lake of the Ozarks</i>, Emmy Award-winning <i>CBS Sunday Morning</i> Correspondent Bill Geist reflects on his coming of age in the American Heartland and traces his evolution as a man and a writer. He shares laugh-out-loud anecdotes and tongue-in-cheek observations guaranteed to evoke a strong sense of nostalgia for "the good ol' days." Written with Geistian wit and warmth, <i>Lake of the Ozarks</i> takes readers back to a bygone era, and demonstrates how you can find inspiration in the most unexpected places.<br><br></p><p><b>Bill Geist </b>is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of<i> </i>nine books, including<i> City Slickers, Little League Confidential</i>, <i>The Big Five-Oh, Fore! Play!</i>, and <i>Way Off the Road</i>. Geist has won numerous Emmys and in 2011 was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for the hundreds of "singular, informative, entertaining" pieces he has done since joining CBS in 1987. He was awarded the Bronze Star for his service as a combat photographer in Vietnam in 1969. In 2018 he retired from CBS having battled Parkinson's disease for twenty-five years. Geist lives in Riverside, Connecticut, with his wife, Jody. They have two children, Willie and Libby, and four grandchildren."Readers of Geist's vintage will enjoy sauntering through his formative summers and perhaps recall some of their own on the way."&#x2015;<b><i>--<i>Booklist</i></i></b><br><br>"A tenderhearted remembrance...Geist's entertaining account of life in a resort town in the 1960s will certainly resonate with folks of his generation, and will offer younger readers a glimpse into a bygone era."&#x2015;<b><i>--<i>Publishers Weekly</i></i></b><br><br>"Geist's writing is consistently nostalgic as he shows how those carefree summers helped mold him into the man he became. The book is a quick, pleasant read that effectively reflects how his time at the lodge showed him that 'life is more difficult and rewarding and fun when you manage to do things your way.' Old-fashioned, wistful stories that will appeal to fans of Geist's previous books."&#x2015;<b><i>--<i>Kirkus</i></i></b><br><br>"It is a sure sign that a book is worthwhile if you can sense the author is having fun writing it. [Geist] just sits down to chat a while. More books should celebrate unbridled nostalgia like this one does."<br><br><br>&#x2015;<b><i><i>--The Florida Times Union</i></i></b><br><br>"Funny, poignant, and memorable, Bill Geist's memoir of his summers in the distant Ozarks -- distant in space and now in time -- is an entertaining and illuminating journey into the past of a fascinating man and an always-intriguing country. It's too bad we can't all get a rubber tomahawk and a Lake of the Ozarks ashtray with each purchase of the book, but life's taught us that you can't have everything."&#x2015;<b><i>--<b>Jon Meacham, </b>Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <i>The Soul of America</i></i></b><br><br>"<i>Lake of the Ozarks</i> is the hilarious account by Bill Geist of his bizarre coming-of-age in a 'different' place and time.

In Raymond Briggs's charming tale, told with 175 softly hued, artfully composed frames, a little boy makes friends with a snowman. He wakes up on a snowy day, tells his mother he's going outside, then begins a flurry of snowman-building. That night, he can't sleep, so he opens the front door and lo! the snowman has come to life. The amiable yet frosty fellow enjoys his tour of the boy's cozy home; he admires the cat, but is disturbed by the fire. The boy shows him other wonders--the TV and a lamp and running water. Predictably perhaps, he is disturbed by the stove, but likes ice cubes quite a bit. Soon it is the snowman's turn to introduce the boy to <i>his</i> wintry world. They join hands, rise up into the blizzardy air--presumably over Russia and into the Middle East--and then safely back to home sweet home. The boy pops into bed before his parents get up... but when he wakes up the next morning he races outside only to find his new buddy's melted remains, scattered with a few forlorn lumps of coal. Since the book is wordless, you can make up any ending you want... like "Then, in a puff of pink smoke, the snowman recomposed himself and went to live in the boy's garage freezer." Or you could just resign yourself to a peaceful "And that was that." Raymond Briggs's <i>The Snowman</i> won the Boston Globe-Horn Book Award, and this wintertime classic continues to win the hearts of kids every year.

At school he is bullied by kids who do not understand that despite his quiet ways and quirky behaviors, Holden is very happy and socially normal on the inside, where he lives in a private world all his own.Then one day the head cheerleader and star of the high school drama production is rehearsing when Holden stops and listens, clearly drawn to the music. Lauren Reynolds notices and takes an interest in him, learning about autism and eventually helping Holden win a spot in the school play.At the same time Lauren makes a dramatic discovery. Long ago, her parents and Holden&#39;s parents were good friends, and she and Holden played together until his diagnosis of autism, at which time Lauren&#39;s mother distanced herself from the friendship. Now Lauren&#39;s mom and her MLB baseball player are father are trapped in an unhappy marriage and a life that is shallow and meaningless.Not until a tragedy takes place at the high school does Lauren take a public stand against the way the more popular privileged kids treat those who are different. At the same time, Lauren continues to be a friend to Holden and in time their mothers realize that something special is happening. Hurts from the past are dealt with and all around Holden miracles begin to happen in various relationships. The greatest miracle is the change in Holden, himself, and everyone is stunned by the transformation they witness. Ultimately, the community comes to understand that many people walk around in a personal prison and that only by love and faith can the doors become unlocked, the way they dramatically do for Holden Harris.<p>Karen Kingsbury, #1&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;bestselling novelist, is America&#x2019;s favorite inspirational storyteller, with more than twenty-five million copies of her award-winning books in print.

Today, income from selling songs has plummeted, even for superstars like James Taylor and Taylor Swift. The real money nowadays is derived from concert sales. In 2017, for example, Billy Joel earned $27.4 million from his live performances, and less than $2 million from record sales and streaming. Even Paul McCartney, who has written and recorded more number one songs than anyone in music history, today, earns 80 percent of his income from live concerts. Krueger tackles commonly asked questions: How does a song become popular? And how does a new artist break out in today's winner-take-all economy? How can musicians and everyday workers earn a living in the digital economy?</p><p>ALAN B. KRUEGER&nbsp;was the James Madison Professor of Political Economy at Princeton University, and a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama. He also served as assistant secretary for economic policy and chief economist of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. He was a recipient of the Moynihan Prize.<p>Chapter 1</p><p>Prelude</p><p>Somebody said to me, &#x201c;But the Beatles were anti-materialistic.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s a huge myth. John and I literally used to sit down and say, &#x201c;Now, let&#x2019;s write a swimming pool.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Paul McCartney</p><p><br>&#x201c;What walk-on music would you like?&#x201d; It was a question I had never been asked before or since. I was about to give a speech at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and my hosts wanted to know which songs to play before I took the stage.</p><p>No, I wasn&#x2019;t about to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. I&#x2019;m not a musician and I can&#x2019;t even carry a tune. I&#x2019;m an economics professor at Princeton. I was then the chairman of the President&#x2019;s Council of Economic Advisers. I had been invited to speak because I had the idea of using the music industry as a metaphor to draw parallels with the U.S. economy--in particular, the financial struggles of middle-class families and the growing gap between the wealthy and everyone else. The key theme was that the U.S. job market had become a superstar, winner-take-all affair, much like the music industry, where a small number of top performers did fabulously well, while almost everyone else struggled to make ends meet.</p><p>The speech used the term rockonomics--meaning the economic study of the music business--to explain why this was happening, what it means for everyday Americans, and what should be done to bring about a fairer economy that works for everyone. I had a list of bold ideas to restore our national hopes and dreams. What better venue to give this speech than the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland?</p><p>My boss at the time, President Obama, liked the idea. Even better, he liked the speech. I sent him a copy when he was flying on Air Force One, and he subsequently announced at a meeting that &#x201c;everyone should read Alan&#x2019;s speech.&#x201d; Soon I was getting requests for a copy from the labor secretary and commerce secretary.</p><p>This book expands on that original rockonomics metaphor to tell the story of how the whole U.S. economy has changed in recent years--and how each of us can prepare for the changes in store in the twenty-first century. In my career I&#x2019;ve found, and psychological research supports, that we learn best not from abstract principles or equations but from stories. And music is all about telling stories.</p><p>Economics is also about telling stories, although the field has acquired the unfortunate and misleading reputation as &#x201c;the dismal science.&#x201d; Economic models, statistics, and regression analyses are all tools used for the purpose of telling stories with rigor and precision. We economists just don&#x2019;t tell the story very well or clearly. This is one of the reasons there was such strong rejection of expertise and basic economic concepts, including gains from trade and the value of impartial, objective economic statistics, during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. We need to find more convincing ways to share the lessons of economics. A broader audience might be willing--even eager--to listen if the story of the economic forces disrupting our world is told through the prism of the music industry. After all, music is one of the few endeavors that unites us, whatever our backgrounds or interests. Almost everyone has a connection to the music industry in one way or another. I call this a theory of &#x201c;one degree of separation,&#x201d; since we are intimately connected to music and the music industry in one way or another through friends, family, and associates.</p><p>To investigate the economic forces shaping the music industry, I conducted dozens of interviews with musicians and music industry executives, from up-and-coming performers and struggling singers to legendary members of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, from executives at Spotify and Amazon to those at Universal Music Group, the largest music company in the world--as well as the owner of my local record shop. (Yes, the Princeton Record Exchange still exists and is thriving, despite a challenging environment for retail stores.)</p><p>I&#x2019;ve interviewed iconic figures who have helped shape the music industry, including Gloria Estefan, the most successful crossover artist of all time, and Quincy Jones, the famed music impresario and performer who produced records for virtually every star from Frank Sinatra to Donna Summer and Michael Jackson. And I met often with Cliff Burnstein and Peter Mensch, the co-founders of Q Prime, which manages Metallica, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Cage the Elephant, Eric Church, and other successful bands. Marc Geiger, the swashbuckling head of music at William Morris Endeavor, shared his optimism for the future of the music biz with me, and top music industry lawyers Don Passman and John Eastman tutored me on music rights and record company contracts. To gain a bird&#x2019;s-eye view of the work and effort involved in putting on a show, I tagged along with musicians and their crews to a number of gigs, and interviewed ushers, vendors, and executives at Live Nation and Ticketmaster.</p><p>Answering questions about money and contractual arrangements is always difficult, especially for artists. A disagreement over money helped break up the Beatles. Money can be a treacherous topic. I am thus especially grateful that so many artists, executives, and industry participants were willing to share their experiences, financial data, and perspectives with me. In the pages that follow I have tried to faithfully reflect their stories to explain the economics of the music business. Most important, I try to convey their passion for creating and sharing music. Perhaps the most powerful lesson that I learned is that it is their love for creating music and entertaining audiences that drives most musicians, rather than expectations of earning a fortune (or even a living).</p><p>As an empirical economist, I believe that theories, observations, and anecdotes must be evaluated in the cold light of objective, representative data. In researching this book, I analyzed data on hundreds of thousands of concerts collected by Pollstar magazine, which gave me unprecedented access to its Pollstar Boxoffice Database. I analyzed data on billions of music streams, millions of record sales and digital downloads, hundreds of thousands of concerts, and thousands of musicians. To fill the gaps, I conducted my own survey of 1,200 professional musicians. By melding firsthand observations from those on the front lines of the music business with Big Data on the industry as a whole, I developed a richer, more reliable, and more representative picture of how economic forces shape the music industry.</p><p>Fortunately, there is also a burgeoning research literature on the music industry by economists, sociologists, psychologists, and computer scientists. Other scholars, too, have found that the music industry provides fertile ground for research, and a scintillating way to inspire and engage students. To provide a forum for researchers to exchange ideas and to support research on the music business across disciplines, in 2016 I helped form a non-profit organization called the Music Industry Research Association (MIRA). This book draws on findings from the innovative social science and related research literature on the music industry.</p><p>Although music listeners may not realize it, economics lies at the heart of the music that is created and produced. Economic forces profoundly affect the music that we listen to, the devices on which we hear it, the genres that are produced, and the amount we pay to attend a live performance, stream music, or buy a recording. When Dick Clark asked Sam Cooke on American Bandstand why he switched from gospel to pop music in the late 1950s, the singer smiled and replied earnestly, &#x201c;My economic situation.&#x201d; And Paul McCartney recently explained to Howard Stern that the Beatles were not trying to create a revolution. &#x201c;We were just kids from a poor area in Liverpool who wanted to make some money.&#x201d; Even if musicians do not personally feel that they are motivated by economic incentives, economic forces quietly orchestrate success and failure. In his book In Praise of Commercial Culture (Harvard University Press), Tyler Cowen has likewise argued that &#x201c;economic effects have had stronger effects on culture than is commonly believed. The printing press paved the way for classical music, while electricity made rock and roll possible. For better or worse, artists are subject to economic constraints.&#x201d;</p><p>To truly understand and appreciate music, you need to understand economics. To take one example, you may have noticed that many more songs today involve collaborations between artists, often where a mega-star is featured with other artists trying to break in or cross over to reach a new audience. &#x201c;Despacito,&#x201d; the most-streamed song in 2017, is a good example: it is by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee and features Justin Bieber. If you listen carefully to songs that feature other singers, you will notice that the star normally appears early in the song, within the first thirty seconds. This is logical because streaming services only pay royalties for music that is streamed for at least thirty seconds. In other words, economic incentives of streaming are directly affecting the way songs are written, composed, and performed.</p><p>Careful economic study of the music industry can shed light on where music is headed, and why. Music and the music business will change over time, but a small number of timeless economic insights can be applied to understand the industry, as new genres and apps are created. More important, understanding the economics of the music industry can yield insights into how economic forces affect our daily lives, work, and society in a myriad of ways.</p></p><h2>Rock, Gem, and Mineral Collecting Sites in Western North Carolina</h2><p><p> </p> <p> Foreword by Ralph Roberts, Publisher There are things you can collect in these old, old mountains that have greater age than antiques. Far greater age. Eons old, and these treasures lie beneath your feet, in the ground, the ancient ground.</p> <p>Rick Jacquot has knowledge of these vastly old artifacts of the earth's creation and its growing pains through millions of long years, now gone. He has searched over mountain and through bramble-choked glen to find the best places, those hallowed, secretive locations yielding the best in specimens of rock, mineral, and-oh yes!-sparkling gemstones. Some of these specimens can be valuable, others precious in the learning of geological lore they impart. All have a story to tell.</p> <p>Often hunters of rocks maintain their secrets as closely as any fisherman protecting that piece of stream where the big trout grab for any hook that comes near the water. Rick does not, he shares it here with you, even to giving GPS coordinates!</p> <p>When Rick brought this book idea to me, I turned out to be an easier sell than he had thought. My father and I spent many happy hours in the pursuit of the not-always-elusive rock. My cousins-Jack Ball and his son Jackie-have ownership of the Little Pine garnet mine in Madison County where my grandfather, George Roberts, was foreman back in its heyday before World War II. I love these mountains-what is on them, in them, and what makes them up. So we, in much pride, add this book to our <b>Land of the Sky</b> series. </p> <p>This book includes:</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li> <p>53 of the best sites in the area</p></li> <li> <p>Maps and GPS Coordinates!</p></li> <li> <p>Restrictions, Owners, Fees</p></li> <li> <p>What you need, what you get</p></li> </ul> </blockquote> <p><b>Introduction</b></p> <p> intro by Rick Jacquot, Author The Western North Carolina area has been mined/prospected off and on for a variety of gems and minerals as far back as the 16th century. I can only imagine what it must have been like to be one of those early prospectors, to be the first one to discover a gem bearing pegmatite or to find gem quality rubies and sapphires in the local creekbeds. Commercial/Systematic mining for various minerals began in the 1700s and in 1871 C.E. Jenks opened the first gem corundum mine.</p> <p> </p> <p>Over the years, improved mining techniques uncovered many more rich gem and mineral deposits. Unfortunately gem production was too low to justify continued commercial mining, mineral mines began to close as imported minerals began to be shipped into the area, it was cheaper to import the minerals from a foreign country than to mine them locally.</p> <p>(left: GEM QU</p></p><p></p><h2>Land&#39;s End: A Walk in Provincetown</h2><p><p>"Cunningham's short book is a haunting, beautiful piece of work. . . .

From pandemics such as HIV, swine flu, and SARS, we are constantly being bombarded with information about new lethal infections. In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em> Dorothy Crawford demonstrates how clever these entities really are. From their discovery and the unravelling of their intricate structures, Crawford demonstrates how these tiny parasites are by far the most abundant life forms on the planet. With up to two billion of them in each litre of sea water, viruses play a vital role in controlling the marine environment, and are essential to the ocean's delicate ecosystem. <br><br>In this fully updated edition, Crawford recounts stories of renowned killer viruses such as the recent Ebola and Zika epidemics, as well as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and considers the importance of air travel in facilitating the international spread of viruses in the twenty-first century. Discussing the impact of global warming, which is increasing the range of vector-transmitted viruses such as dengue, yellow fever, and West Nile virus, she also considers the effect this will have on native populations in subtropical and temperate climates of the Americas, Australasia, and Europe. By examining our lifestyle in the 21st century, Crawford looks to the future to ask whether we can ever live in harmony with viruses, and considers the ways in which we may need to adapt to prevent emerging viruses with devastating consequences. <br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES:</strong> The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

Despite remarkable advances in golf club technology, golf instruction, and golf course conditioning, the average golfer's handicap hasn't changed in the past 30 years. Not coincidentally, the nation as a whole is becoming less healthy due to the sedentary lifestyle that is harming our bodies at an alarming rate. We are then taking our dysfunctional bodies to the golf course.<br><br>Roger Fredericks, a leading golf instructor and golf fitness pioneer who has worked with the likes of Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, and Arnold Palmer, takes readers on a step-by-step journey to explain precisely why golfers have a hard time improving and more importantly, what to do about it. In <i>The Flexible Golf Swing,</i> he lays out his commonsense approach and explains in detail the true fundamentals of the golf swing, and precisely how the mechanics are merely symptoms of how a body functions.</p><p>ROGER FREDERICKS has been one of the most influential figures in the golf fitness movement over the past 20 years and is one of the few golf professionals with expertise in both golf instruction and physiology. He has worked on the golf swings and bodies of more than 20,000 golfers, including more than 60 tour professionals and seven Hall of Famers.

He resides in San Diego.CHAPTER&nbsp;1<br><br>MY STORY<br><br>"YOU MUST HAVE ONE HECK OF A SORE LEFT ANKLE WHEN YOU HIT A LOT OF GOLF BALLS." Those words were uttered to me in 1985 by a physical therapist named Ric McDonald, who at the time was the head trainer for the San Diego Chargers football team. Although I didn't know it then, that one sentence would change the course of my life and would actually start me out on a new career.<br><br>That sentence became so important to me that it is etched in my memory. Ric said it just as I was reaching for the doorknob to leave his office. We had just concluded a business meeting that had nothing to do with physical therapy or golf. Flabbergasted, I turned to him and asked, "How did you know that?"<br><br>"Look at your posture," he said. My posture at the time was horrible. I had severe rotation in my hips, and my right shoulder was rounded and pulled down and forward (like with many golfers). He explained the body's natural and correct posture, and he showed me how severely out of balance I was. From there, Ric described my golf swing tendencies and pinpointed precisely how my poor posture was contributing to my swing faults. He explained in detail how my tight right hip and impinged right shoulder were inhibiting my ability to turn my right side on my backswing, how the lack of extension in my right wrist (due to a prosthetic) was forcing the club open, and how my weaker left hip didn't have the ability to stabilize properly as I shifted my weight onto it in the downswing, thus forcing me to spin out, which in turn forced my left foot to roll to the outside, causing me pain. (I remember thinking, "So that's why I've had so many left ankle problems!")<br><br>I was shocked. He had never seen me before, let alone seen me swing a golf club. Yet his diagnosis was absolutely right on. It was like he had a supernatural gift. I was amazed. It was the start of a grand awakening. For the first time, I realized I might be able to end a lifetime of confusion about the golf swing. I might be able to find answers to questions that had been plaguing me since I was a kid.<br><br>THE BEGINNING<br><br>My life in golf started back in Santa Barbara, California, where I grew up. At about age 7, I began following my father, Elmer Fredericks, around the golf course. He was a fine player with a beautiful swing and could hit the ball a mile. I eventually got my first set of clubs--Bobby Jones Juniors. There were two woods, four irons, and a putter. Like most kids starting out, I'd take a wide stance and give it a hockey slap shot type of motion down the fairway.<br><br>When I was 9, my father got me a complete set of First Flight clubs. I couldn't wait for them to arrive. My anticipation was off the charts. They were too long for me, but my dad said they would be fine and that soon enough I'd grow into them. I immediately went out to play with them at La Cumbre Country Club, where my parents were members, and I couldn't have hit the ball any worse if I had tried. The new clubs felt terrible. I was demoralized. My dad had left work early and joined me in the middle of the fourth fairway to see how I was doing with the new clubs. What he found was a very disconsolate son.<br><br>He told me to hit a few balls so he could figure out why I was hitting bad shots. He watched for a few minutes, and then he confidently said, "I've got it! I know exactly what is happening. Because the clubs are longer, you're going to need to take it back longer so you can create more leverage." He told me to take the club back low and slow, and swing it back as far as possible--and wait for it at the top. His advice produced a much longer, rhythmic swing. Up until then, I had a very short backswing that had worked just fine with my old set, but it wasn't well suited for these longer clubs.<br><br>Fig. 1.1 Roger in the early days<br><br>THE MAGIC MOMENT<br><br>This actually was my first lesson, and it changed my relationship with golf. It was unbelievable. Every shot I hit was high and long. From that moment, I became compulsive--amazed that by simply making one little change in my swing I could make such a profound difference! I had discovered the magic that is legendary in golf. That particular day was the beginning of my search for the secrets of the golf swing.<br><br>Most golfers, I have come to realize, are looking for this magic in their games. Nearly all golfers spend their lives searching for some swing secrets, or that one little thing that will make a difference. Everybody goes through this, from Joe Hacker to golf's greatest players. I see this all the time in my golf schools, and it never fails to remind me of that day when I first found the magic in the company of my father. I remember it vividly: the flight of the ball, the consistency of my shots, and the absolute joy of discovering that one little thing that made such a dramatic difference.<br><br>There is purity and innocence in this joy, and it is something I see frequently in my students. We can be incredibly successful as adults and yet, at the same time, we can retain that childlike quality of excitement and zeal about golf.<br><br>The game of golf offers a lifetime of discoveries--new swing tips that lead to the overwhelming feeling that we've finally got it and it won't go away. Even when it disappears, as it inevitably does, we can get it back. Golf, after all, is a quest that never ends. Looking back now, I realize that magic moment with my father was the start of my golf instructional odyssey. It didn't take me long to become one of the greatest golf swing psycho junkies who ever lived. There wasn't a round of golf that I played when I wasn't trying something new or different, and this pattern went on for decades.<br><br>ADDICTED TO GOLF LESSONS<br><br>As a junior golfer, I took lessons from several renowned teachers, but ultimately I still played by feel. I received a partial golf scholarship to Arizona State University, which had (and still has) one of the top college golf programs in the country.<br><br>In 1972, after college, I turned professional and worked hard on my game in preparation for the PGA qualifying school in the fall. In June of that year, I suffered a very serious wrist injury, which eventually required two major surgeries. In the first surgery, doctors did a bone graft, taking bone out of my hip and transplanting it into my wrist. That surgery failed and my wrist got worse. In the next surgery, a year or so later, they literally cut one of my metacarpal bones in half and inserted a prosthetic (which is still there today). The recovery process took more than a year and a half, and I was in a cast much of that time. When I was finally able to resume playing, I noticed a tremendous difference in the way I hit the ball. What I discovered was that my old reliable right-to-left draw, the shot I had hit all my life, was completely gone. It was replaced by a weak push-fade that really didn't go anywhere. My accuracy was gone, too, along with my confidence.<br><br>This confused me terribly. To get back on the right track, I sought golf instruction from anyone and everyone. I took lessons from a legion of teachers. You name them, I probably went to them. If I didn't see them, I read their books or watched their videos, or I picked the brains of people who had seen them. I tried everything imaginable. Even more confusing was that many of these teachers had opposing theories about the golf swing. These theories often conflicted with each other so much that I became entirely confused. When I say I took lessons from them, I don't mean an occasional lesson here or there. I mean I worked at it. I'd sometimes hit 500 balls a day trying to groove what they were teaching me.<br><br>I also trained with Chinese martial arts teachers to learn and adapt energy transfer and power concepts to the golf swing. More than once, I persuaded a Chinese kung fu master to try to figure out the golf swing. Each one was as fascinated and confused as I was.<br><br>Claude Harmon and Paul Runyan were two of the great instructors whom I saw for several years. Although both were incredibly knowledgeable, their teaching concepts were diametrically opposed. For example, Claude wanted me to play with a weak left-hand grip; Paul wanted a strong left-hand position. Claude advocated a wide stance; Paul liked a narrow stance. Claude told me to keep my hands high at address; Paul wanted them low. Claude wanted me to set my wrists early; Paul wanted me to drag the club back. You get the picture? And that was just to address and start the swing. When it came to the full swing, I was unable to simplify things. Every teacher had a different theory.<br><br>I wouldn't be surprised if I drove many of these teachers to their psychiatrists' couches because of the countless questions I asked. While I listened and tried to learn each system, I couldn't help but notice that a high percentage of great players had unorthodox swings. Furthermore, their swings were so distinctive that seldom did you ever see any two people swing the same way. Just look at the swings of Arnold Palmer, Lee Trevino, Chi Chi Rodriguez, Doug Sanders, Miller Barber, Jim Furyk, and others, and you'll see what I mean.<br><br>There were dozens of great players whose golf swings weren't even close to each other. I'd watch very successful players with short swings and long swings, strong grips and weak grips, early wrist sets and one-piece takeaways, cupped wrists and flat wrists, upright swings and flat swings. I would often go to my teachers and say something like, "You know, I was watching Lee Trevino and Gene Littler play the other day, and their swings are completely different. They don't do what you're telling me to do."<br><br>Most teachers would tell me those players were exceptions. That made sense at the time. Yet, it never occurred to me that maybe I was an exception. In fact, maybe we're all exceptions and are all "uniquely unique."<br><br>CLUELESS ABOUT THE GOLF SWING<br><br>This instructional journey lasted for nearly 12 years, and my golf game went from PGA Tour material to an 8-handicap. The odds were 50-50 if I would break 80 on any given day. I can honestly say that, after all the different methods and all the different teachers, nobody made me a better golfer. Nobody gave me the "secret" or made me feel confident in my skills. In fact, I got so confused that I was literally lost in a maze from which there was no escape. I barely knew which end of the club to hold. I thought of quitting the game all the time, but I couldn't. I was a psychological mess.<br><br>I didn't realize at the time that all my experiences--as a player and especially as a student of all these great teachers--would eventually help me become a better instructor. Everything I went through--all the joy and frustration--would motivate me to understand the complexities of the golf swing. I feel strongly that to be a good teacher, one has to experience much of this to be able to comprehend what is happening inside the minds and bodies of one's students. Golf is a perplexing mental game, and an excellent instructor has to be a psychologist and a motivator, as well as a master of the golf swing.<br><br>DOCTORS AND FAITH HEALERS<br><br>To complicate the situation, my body began to deteriorate as I struggled with my golf game. My left knee was painful all the time. This required two knee surgeries to go along with my two wrist surgeries. Occasionally, I suffered from shooting sciatica that would sear down my hip and legs. I didn't know what I was going to do with my life.<br><br>The story of my body parallels the story of my golf swing. That is, I went to everybody to fix my knee pain. You name them, I've been to them-- orthopedic surgeons, physical therapists, Rolfists, chiropractors, deep- tissue massage therapists, acupuncturists, acupressurists, martial artists, even a Filipino faith healer (who actually helped by explaining to me that my knee problem was a symptom of my misaligned hips). And, just like with my golf swing, nobody or any of their treatments provided a definitive answer. In fact, with each passing year, my knee got worse and worse until my left patella (kneecap) would literally slide off of its track.<br><br>Despite all this, I never gave up the dream of playing on the PGA Tour. I worked very hard on my game with the intent of someday, somehow, making it to the Tour. I never gave up that dream--until I played a round of golf one day with Craig Stadler.<br><br>THE CRAIG STADLER DECISION<br><br>I was invited to play with Craig Stadler at La Jolla Country Club near San Diego. Craig arrived at the course about 1 minute before our tee time and didn't hit one warmup shot. He went straight from the parking lot to the first tee. Despite missing two 20-inch putts, he shot the easiest 65 that I've ever seen. And he didn't seem elated at all. In fact, he seemed like he didn't even care. If that had been me, I would've been celebrating for weeks. Even the good rounds that I had shot seemed like hard work. Never had I shot a round with the ease that he had--and I had been practicing my game for years. Right then I experienced a moment of clarity. I asked myself, "What in the world am I trying to do?" And right then I gave up my dream of playing on the PGA Tour. That decision turned out to be a good thing because fate had something else in mind.<br><br>THE MEN WHO CHANGED THE DIRECTION OF MY LIFE<br><br>By the time I met Ric McDonald, he had been the head trainer of the San Diego Chargers for 19 years. His reputation in the field of physical therapy was legendary. He had recently joined forces with a unique anatomical functionalist named Pete Egoscue (who eventually became Jack Nicklaus's trainer and opened the internationally renowned Egoscue clinics).</p><h2>The Conspiracy to Destroy Black Women</h2><p>It has long been argued that women, especially black women, have been relegated to a second-class status in American society, and despite modern advances remain subject to a debilitating discrimination in many areas of life. This book presents a fresh perspective on the many facets of sexism experienced by African American women, addressing such issues as wage disparity, spousal abuse, and the rising rate of AIDS among black women. It also examines the roots of sexism among African American males, including the effect of gangster rap music on perceptions of black women, and offers strategies for change.<br></p><p><b>Michael Porter</b> is the author of <i>Kill Them Before They Grow</i>.

Laura lives in the little house with her Pa, her Ma, her sisters Mary and Carrie, and their trusty dog, Jack. Pioneer life is sometimes hard for the family, since they must grow or catch all their own food as they get ready for the cold winter. But it is also exciting as Laura and her family celebrate Christmas with homemade toys and treats, do the spring planting, bring in the harvest, and make their first trip into town. And every night they are safe and warm in their little house, with the happy sound of Pa's fiddle sending Laura and her sisters off to sleep.</p><p>And so begins Laura Ingalls Wilder's beloved story of a pioneer girl and her family. The nine Little House books have been cherished by generations of readers as both a unique glimpse into America's frontier history and a heartwarming, unforgettable story.</p></p><p>Although the Little House stories are traditionally seen as "girl" books, boys might be happily surprised if they take another peek at their sisters' shelves. <i>Little House in the Big Woods</i>--the first book of the series and Laura Ingalls Wilder's first children's book--is full of the thrills, chills, and spills typically associated with "boy" books.

Once the black swans arrive, once we awaken to numerous mile long shadows cast by these ancient ships&#x2014;hanging over our major cities, soundless, motionless, maddening; it will be too late. It is in these final moments that we can still, with open minds and clear hearts, decipher that which has been intentionally hidden from humanity for so long&#x2014;the truth of Extra-Dimensionality. That comprehension will, in turn, illuminate every hidden truth of our material existence. Then, we will find that for the first time, we will finally have the key to understanding everything.</p><p>JOHN DESOUZA was an FBI Special Agent for over 20 years and collector of the real life &#34;X-Files.&#34; The author has researched and uncovered paranormal experiences as they have been revealed to him.

Habits are the invisible architecture of everyday life.&nbsp;It takes work to make a habit, but once that habit is set, we can harness the energy of habits to build happier, stronger, more productive lives.<br> &nbsp;<br> So if habits are a key to change, then what we really need to know is: <i>How do we change our habits</i>?<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Better than Before</i> answers that question. It presents a practical, concrete framework to allow readers to understand their habits&#x2014;and to change them for good. Infused with Rubin&#x2019;s compelling voice, rigorous research, and easy humor, and packed with vivid stories of lives transformed, <i>Better than Before</i> explains the (sometimes counter-intuitive) core principles of habit formation. <br> &nbsp;<br> Along the way, Rubin uses herself as guinea pig, tests her theories on family and friends, and answers readers&#x2019; most pressing questions&#x2014;oddly, questions that other writers and researchers tend to ignore:&nbsp;<br><br>�&nbsp;Why do I find it tough to create a habit for something I&nbsp;<i>love</i>&nbsp;to do? <br>�&nbsp;Sometimes I can change a habit overnight, and sometimes I can&#x2019;t change a habit, no matter how hard I try. Why? <br>�&nbsp;How quickly can I change a habit? <br>�&nbsp;What can I do to make sure I stick to a new habit? <br>�&nbsp;How can I help someone else change a habit? <br>�&nbsp;Why can I keep habits that benefit others, but can&#x2019;t make habits that are just for me? <br><br> Whether readers want to get more sleep, stop checking their devices, maintain a healthy weight, or finish an important project, habits make&nbsp;change possible. Reading just a few chapters of <i>Better Than Before</i> will make readers eager to start work on their own habits&#x2014;even before they&#x2019;ve finished the book.</p><p><p><b>Gretchen Rubin</b>, a member of Oprah's SuperSoul 100, is one of the most thought-provoking and influential writers on the linked subjects of habits, happiness, and human nature.

Some are serious, such as &#x201c;Just because something is fun for someone else doesn&#x2019;t mean it&#x2019;s fun for me,&#x201d; and some are goofy, such as &#x201c;Food tastes better when I eat with my hands.&#x201d; One of my most important Secrets of Adulthood, however, is: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m more like other people, and less like other people, than I suppose.&#x201d; While I&#x2019;m not much different from other people, those differences are very important.<br><br>For this reason, the same habit strategies don&#x2019;t work for everyone. If we know ourselves, we&#x2019;re able to manage ourselves better, and if we&#x2019;re trying to work with others, it helps to understand them.<br><br>So I would start with self-knowledge, by identifying how my nature affects my habits. Figuring that out, however, isn&#x2019;t easy. As novelist John Updike observed, &#x201c;Surprisingly few clues are ever offered us as to what kind of people we are.&#x201d;<br><br>In my research, I&#x2019;d looked for a good framework to explain differences in how people respond to habits, but to my surprise, none existed. Was I the only one who wondered why some people adopt habits much more, or less, readily than other people? Or why some people dread habits? Or why some people are able to keep certain habits, in certain situations, but not others?<br><br>I couldn&#x2019;t figure out the pattern--then one afternoon, eureka. The answer didn&#x2019;t emerge from my library research, but from my preoccupation with the question my friend had asked me. I&#x2019;d been pondering, yet again, her simple observation: she&#x2019;d never missed practice for her high school track team, but she can&#x2019;t make herself go running now. Why?<br><br>As my idea hit, I felt the same excitement that Archimedes must have felt when he stepped into his bath. Suddenly I grasped it. The first and most important habits question is: &#x201c;How does a person respond to an expectation?&#x201d; When we try to form a new habit, we set an expectation for ourselves. Therefore, it&#x2019;s crucial to understand how we respond to expectations.<br><br>We face two kinds of expectations: outer expectations (meet work deadlines, observe traffic regulations) and inner expectations (stop napping, keep a New Year&#x2019;s resolution). From my observation, just about everyone falls into one of four distinct groups:<br><br>Upholders respond readily to both outer expectations and inner expectations.<br><br>Questioners question all expectations, and will meet an expectation only if they believe it&#x2019;s justified.<br><br>Obligers respond readily to outer expectations but struggle to meet inner expectations (my friend on the track team).<br><br>Rebels resist all expectations, outer and inner alike.<br>As I struggled to find a name for this framework, one of my favorite passages, from Sigmund Freud&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Theme of the Three Caskets,&#x201d; floated into my head. Freud explains that the names of the three goddesses of fate mean &#x201c;the accidental within the decrees of destiny,&#x201d; &#x201c;the inevitable,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the fateful tendencies each one of us brings into the world.&#x201d; The fateful tendencies each one of us brings into the world.<br><br>I decided to name my framework the &#x201c;Four Tendencies.&#x201d; (The &#x201c;Four Fateful Tendencies,&#x201d; though accurate, sounded a little melodramatic.)<br><br>As I developed the framework of the Four Tendencies, I truly felt as though I were discovering the Periodic Table of the Elements--the elements of character. I wasn&#x2019;t making up a system; I was uncovering a law of nature. Or perhaps I&#x2019;d created a habits Sorting Hat.<br><br>Our Tendency colors the way we see the world and therefore has enormous consequences for our habits. Of course, these are tendencies, but I&#x2019;ve found, to a degree that surprises me, that most people do fall squarely into one camp, and once I identified the Tendencies, I got a kick from hearing the people within a given Tendency make the same kinds of comments, over and over. Questioners, for example, often remark on how much they hate to wait in line.<br>UPHOLDERS<br><br>Upholders respond readily to outer expectations and inner expectations. They wake up and think: &#x201c;What&#x2019;s on the schedule and the to-do list for today?&#x201d; They want to know what&#x2019;s expected of them, and to meet those expectations. They avoid making mistakes or letting people down--including themselves.<br><br>Others can rely on Upholders, and Upholders can rely on themselves. They&#x2019;re self-directed and have little trouble meeting commitments, keeping resolutions, or meeting deadlines (they often finish early). They want to understand the rules, and often they search for the rules beyond the rules--as in the case of art or ethics.<br><br>One friend with an Upholder wife told me, &#x201c;If something is on the schedule, my wife is going to do it. When we were in Thailand, we&#x2019;d planned to visit a certain temple, and we went--even though she got food poisoning the night before and was throwing up on our way there.&#x201d;<br><br>Because Upholders feel a real obligation to meet their expectations for themselves, they have a strong instinct for self-preservation, and this helps protect them from their tendency to meet others&#x2019; expectations. &#x201c;I need a lot of time for myself,&#x201d; an Upholder friend told me, &#x201c;to exercise, to kick around new ideas for work, to listen to music. If people ask me to do things that interfere, it&#x2019;s easy for me to tell them &#x2018;no.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>However, Upholders may struggle in situations where expectations aren&#x2019;t clear or the rules aren&#x2019;t established. They may feel compelled to meet expectations, even ones that seem pointless. They may feel uneasy when they know they&#x2019;re breaking the rules, even unnecessary rules, unless they work out a powerful justification to do so.<br><br>This is my Tendency. I&#x2019;m an Upholder.<br><br>My Upholder Tendency sometimes makes me overly concerned with following the rules. Years ago, when I pulled out my laptop to work in a coffee shop, the barista told me, &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t use a laptop in here.&#x201d; Now every time I go to a new coffee shop, I worry about whether I can use my laptop.<br><br>There&#x2019;s a relentless quality to Upholders, too. I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s tiresome for Jamie--sometimes, it&#x2019;s even tiresome for me--to hear my alarm go off every morning at 6:00. I have an Upholder friend who estimates that she skips going to the gym only about six times a year.<br><br>&#x201c;How does your family feel about that?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, my husband used to complain. Now he&#x2019;s used to it.&#x201d;<br><br>Although I love being an Upholder, I see its dark side, too--the gold-star seeking, the hoop jumping, the sometimes mindless rule following.<br><br>When I figured out that I was an Upholder, I understood why I&#x2019;d been drawn to the study of habits. We Upholders find it relatively easy to cultivate habits--it&#x2019;s not easy, but it&#x2019;s easier than for many other people--and we embrace them because we find them gratifying. But the fact that even habit-loving Upholders must struggle to foster good habits shows how challenging it is to form habits.<br>QUESTIONERS<br><br>Questioners question all expectations, and they respond to an expectation only if they conclude that it makes sense. They&#x2019;re motivated by reason, logic, and fairness. They wake up and think, &#x201c;What needs to get done today, and why?&#x201d; They decide for themselves whether a course of action is a good idea, and they resist doing anything that seems to lack sound purpose. Essentially, they turn all expectations into inner expectations. As one Questioner wrote on my blog: &#x201c;I refuse to follow arbitrary rules (I jaywalk, as long as there are no cars coming, and I&#x2019;ll go through a red light if it&#x2019;s the middle of the night, and there&#x2019;s no other traffic in sight) but rules that I find based in morality/ethics/reason are very compelling.&#x201d;<br><br>A friend said, &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t I take my vitamins? My doctor tells me I should, but usually I don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>She&#x2019;s a Questioner, so I asked, &#x201c;Do you believe that you need to take vitamins?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, no,&#x201d; she answered, after a pause, &#x201c;as a matter of fact, I don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I bet you&#x2019;d take them if you thought they mattered.&#x201d;<br><br>Questioners resist rules for rules&#x2019; sake. A reader posted on my blog: &#x201c;My son&#x2019;s school principal said that kids were expected to tuck in their shirts. When I expressed surprise at this seemingly arbitrary rule, the principal said that the school had many rules just for the sake of teaching children to follow rules. That&#x2019;s a dumb reason to ask anyone, including children, to follow a rule. If we know of such rules we should seek and destroy them, to make the world a better place.&#x201d;<br><br>Because Questioners like to make well-considered decisions and come to their own conclusions, they&#x2019;re very intellectually engaged, and they&#x2019;re often willing to do exhaustive research. If they decide there&#x2019;s sufficient basis for an expectation, they&#x2019;ll follow it; if not, they won&#x2019;t. Another Questioner said, &#x201c;My wife is annoyed with me, because she really wants us both to track our spending. But we&#x2019;re not in debt, we spend within our means, so I don&#x2019;t think that getting that information is worth the hassle. So I won&#x2019;t do it.&#x201d;<br><br>Questioners resist anything that seems arbitrary; for instance, Questioners often remark, &#x201c;I can keep a resolution if I think it&#x2019;s important, but I wouldn&#x2019;t make a New Year&#x2019;s resolution, because January first is a meaningless date.&#x201d;<br><br>At times, the Questioner&#x2019;s appetite for information and justification can become overwhelming. &#x201c;My mother makes me insane,&#x201d; one reader reported, &#x201c;because she expects me to need tons of information the way she does. She constantly asks questions that I didn&#x2019;t ask, wouldn&#x2019;t ask, and generally don&#x2019;t think I need to know the answers to.&#x201d; Questioners themselves sometimes wish they could accept expectations without probing them so relentlessly. A Questioner told me ruefully, &#x201c;I suffer from analysis paralysis. I always want to have one more piece of information.&#x201d;<br><br>Questioners are motivated by sound reasons--or at least what they believe to be sound reasons. In fact, Questioners can sometimes seem like crackpots, because they may reject expert opinion in favor of their own conclusions. They ignore those who say, &#x201c;Why do you think you know more about cancer than your doctor?&#x201d; or &#x201c;Everyone prepares the report one way, why do you insist on your own crazy format?&#x201d;<br><br>Questioners come in two flavors: some Questioners have an inclination to Uphold, and others have an inclination to Rebel (like being &#x201c;Virgo with Scorpio rising&#x201d;). My husband, Jamie, questions everything, but it&#x2019;s not too hard to persuade him to uphold. As an Upholder, I doubt I could be married happily to someone who wasn&#x2019;t an Upholder or a Questioner/Upholder. Which is a sobering thought.<br><br>If Questioners believe that a particular habit is worthwhile, they&#x2019;ll stick to it--but only if they&#x2019;re satisfied about the habit&#x2019;s usefulness.<br>OBLIGERS<br><br>Obligers meet outer expectations, but struggle to meet inner expectations. They&#x2019;re motivated by external accountability; they wake up and think, &#x201c;What must I do today?&#x201d; Because Obligers excel at meeting external demands and deadlines, and go to great lengths to meet their responsibilities, they make terrific colleagues, family members, and friends--which I know firsthand, because my mother and my sister are both Obligers.<br><br>Because Obligers resist inner expectations, it&#x2019;s difficult for them to self-motivate--to work on a PhD thesis, to attend networking events, to get their car serviced. Obligers depend on external accountability, with consequences such as deadlines, late fees, or the fear of letting other people down. One Obliger wrote on my blog, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t feel a sense of accountability to my calendar, just to the people associated with the appointments. If the entry is just &#x2018;go for a jog&#x2019; I&#x2019;m not likely to do it.&#x201d; Another Obliger summarized: &#x201c;Promises made to yourself can be broken. It&#x2019;s the promises made to others that should never be broken.&#x201d; Obligers need external accountability even for activities that they want to do. An Obliger told me, &#x201c;I never made time to read, so I joined a book group where you&#x2019;re really expected to read the book.&#x201d;<br><br>Behavior that Obligers sometimes attribute to self-sacrifice--&#x201c;Why do I always make time for other people&#x2019;s priorities at the expense of my own priorities?&#x201d;--is often better explained as need for accountability.<br><br>Obligers find ingenious ways to create external accountability. One Obliger explained, &#x201c;I wanted to go to basketball games, but I never went. I bought season tickets with my brother, and now I go, because he&#x2019;s annoyed if I don&#x2019;t show.&#x201d; Another said, &#x201c;If I want to clean out my closet this weekend, I call a charity now, to come and pick up my donations on Monday.&#x201d; Another Obliger said, with regret, &#x201c;I signed up for a photography course, because I knew I needed assignments and deadlines. I took several classes, then thought, &#x2018;I love it, so I don&#x2019;t need to take a class.&#x2019; Guess how many photos I&#x2019;ve taken since? One.&#x201d; Next semester, he&#x2019;s taking a class.<br><br>The need to be a role model often prompts Obligers to keep good habits. One Obliger friend eats vegetables only when his children can see him, and another told me, &#x201c;I knew I&#x2019;d never practice piano, so I waited until my kids could take lessons--and now we do it together, and I have to practice, because if I don&#x2019;t, they won&#x2019;t.&#x201d; Obligers can sometimes do things for the sake of others that they couldn&#x2019;t do for themselves. Several Obligers told me, practically in the same words, &#x201c;If it weren&#x2019;t for the children, I&#x2019;d still be stuck in a bad marriage. I had to get the divorce for my kids.&#x201d;<br><br>The weight of outer expectations can make Obligers susceptible to burnout, because they have trouble telling people &#x201c;no.&#x201d; An Obliger explained, &#x201c;I drop everything to proofread my colleagues&#x2019; reports, but I&#x2019;m terrible about making time to finish my own reports.&#x201d;<br><br>Obligers may find it difficult to form a habit, because often we undertake habits for our own benefit, and Obligers do things more easily for others than for themselves. For them, the key is external accountability.<br>REBELS<br><br>Rebels resist all expectations, outer and inner alike. They choose to act from a sense of choice, of freedom. Rebels wake up and think, &#x201c;What do I want to do today?&#x201d; They resist control, even self-control, and enjoy flouting rules and expectations.<br><br>Rebels work toward their own goals, in their own way, and while they refuse to do what they&#x2019;re &#x201c;supposed&#x201d; to do, they can accomplish their own aims. One Rebel told me, &#x201c;My master&#x2019;s thesis was ten pages shorter than recommended, and I convinced the department to add an unconventional adviser to my panel. So I got it done and did well on it--but on my terms.&#x201d;</p><h2>A Year with the Catechism: 365 Day Reading Plan</h2><p><p>The Catechism of the Catholic Church gives Catholics everything they need to have a greater understanding of the faith.

Sexy and shrewd, she quickly went from streetwalker to madam and by 1920 had opened what became a legendary house of prostitution. There she entertained a steady stream of governors, gangsters, and movie stars until she was arrested at last in 1962. Shortly before she died in 1974, she tape-recorded her memories-the scandalous stories of a powerful woman who had the city's politicians in her pocket and whose lovers included the twenty-five-year-old boy next door, whom she married when she was sixty-four. Combining those tapes with original research, Christine Wiltz chronicles not just Norma's rise and fall but also the social history of New Orleans, thick with the vice and corruption that flourished there-and, like <i>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</i> and <i>Philistines at the Hedgerow,</i> resurrects a vanished secret world.</p><p>Actually, they called themselves "landladies" in New Orleans, though that didn't change the nature of their business: running houses of prostitution in the city's wide-open French Quarter. Beginning in 1920, when she was still in her teens, Norma Wallace managed a high-class bordello for an affluent and influential clientele, evading the police and asserting her sexual freedom "like a man" despite the nominal confines of several rickety marriages. Obsessive love for a man 39 years her junior and her first-ever jail term finally put Wallace out of the business in the mid-1960s, but her memories were still vivid and raunchy when she tape-recorded material for an autobiography in the two years before her suicide in 1974. Novelist Christine Wiltz makes good use of those recordings in an earthy narrative filled with great anecdotes, from how the name of Wallace's dog became local slang for an out-of-town customer to the time an undertaker's premises served as her temporary place of business. Wiltz also interviewed many of Wallace's lovers and associates; she draws on popular journalism and scholarly monographs with equal acuity to flesh out Norma's story. Her perceptive biography of a colorful and complex woman is equally satisfying as a social history of 20th-century New Orleans. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Writing <i>The Last Madam: A Life in the New Orleans Underworld</i> began with a call from Norma Wallace's fifth husband's wife.&nbsp; Jean Bernard had decided it was time to do something with all the papers Norma had left that were stuffed into a tall secretary in her living room.&nbsp; Norma had begun taping her life, and Jean invited me over to review those tapes.&nbsp; That was the beginning of a five year journey for me.&nbsp; Even though Norma's house was the last of the wide-open French Quarter parlor houses and everyone from the mayor down knew she operated (she had an opening in a wall of the room she called the Music Room where she slipped the police their "take"), Norma lived a life of discretion in deference to her customers.&nbsp; Her "tell-all" tapes left a lot out, and so over five years I interviewed people she'd mentioned, politicos from as far back as the fifties (she operated for over forty years), a former Chief of Police, and all the while trying to find men who had gone to the house who would talk and locating one of her girls.&nbsp; I finally found both.&nbsp; The "girl" was one of the most amazing women I've ever met, Rose Mary Miorana, who Norma called the worst hooker in the world but who was her life-long friend.&nbsp; Rose Mary had a child with severe cerebral palsy whom she'd kept alive for over thirty years, and who was as charming as she was.&nbsp; I shaped the story out of interviews with her and over 100 others to tell the story of a woman who was way ahead of her time--powerful, wealthy, and who married five times, each husband younger than the one before, until she met Wayne Bernard who was 39 years younger.</p><h2>The Know-It-All: One Man&#39;s Humble Quest to Become the Smartest Person in the World</h2><p>Part memoir and part education (or lack thereof), <i>The Know-It-All</i> chronicles NPR contributor A.J.

With the publication of Albert Einstein's "special" and "general" theories of relativity, however, traditional approaches to solving the riddles of space and time crumbled. In their place stood a radically new view of the physical world, providing answers to many of the unsolved mysteries of pre-Einsteinian physics.<br>Acclaimed as the pinnacle of scientific philosophy, the theories of relativity tend to be regarded as the exclusive domain of highly trained scientific minds. The great physicist himself disclaimed this exclusionary view, and in this book, he explains both theories in their simplest and most intelligible form for the layman not versed in the mathematical foundations of theoretical physics.<br>In addition to the theories themselves, this book contains a final part presenting fascinating considerations on the universe as a whole. Appendices cover the simple derivation of the Lorentz transformation, Minkowski's four-dimensional space, and the experimental confirmation of the general theory of relativity. Students, teachers, and other scientifically minded readers will appreciate this inexpensive and accessible interpretation of one of the world's greatest intellectual accomplishments. </p><p></p></p><p>How better to learn the Special Theory of Relativity and the General Theory of Relativity than directly from their creator, Albert Einstein himself? In <i>Relativity: The Special and the General Theory,</i> Einstein describes the theories that made him famous, illuminating his case with numerous examples and a smattering of math (nothing more complex than high-school algebra). Einstein's book is not casual reading, but for those who appreciate his work without diving into the arcana of theoretical physics, <i>Relativity</i> will prove a stimulating read."The additions to the original text give considerable insight and are a valuable addition, particularly for anyone approaching the subject for the first time."<br> &#x2014;<i>Choice</i> <br><br> "It&#x2019;s as though you are sitting in his classroom, watching [Einstein] alternate between gesticulating and chalking equations onto the blackboard."<br> &#x2014;<i>The Washington Post Book World</i></p><h2>The Rise of Victimhood Culture: Microaggressions, Safe Spaces, and the New Culture Wars</h2><p><i>The Rise of Victimhood Culture</i> offers a framework for understanding recent moral conflicts at U.S. universities, which have bled into society at large. These are not the familiar clashes between liberals and conservatives or the religious and the secular: instead, they are clashes between a new moral culture&#x2015;victimhood culture&#x2015;and a more traditional culture of dignity. Even as students increasingly demand trigger warnings and &#x201c;safe spaces,&#x201d; many young people are quick to police the words and deeds of others, who in turn claim that political correctness has run amok. Interestingly, members of both camps often consider themselves victims of the other. In tracking the rise of victimhood culture, Bradley Campbell and Jason Manning help to decode an often dizzying cultural milieu, from campus riots over conservative speakers and debates around free speech to the election of Donald Trump.&nbsp;</p><p>Bradley Campbell is Associate Professor of Sociology at California State University, Los Angeles, USA.<br><br>Jason Manning is Associate Professor of Sociology at West Virginia University, USA.<br><br><p>Selected by Choice magazine as an <b>Outstanding Academic Title</b> for 2018</p>&#x201c;Comprehensive, measured, and well researched, this may be the most important book of the year.

Series)</h2><p><b><i>Yurei Attack!</i> is a nightmare-inducing one-stop guide to Japan's traditional ghosts and spirits.</b><br><br>Surviving encounters with angry ghosts and sexy specters. Haunted places. Dangerous games and how to play them. And more importantly, a guided tour of what awaits in the world of the dead. <br><br>Yurei is the Japanese word for "ghost." It's as simple as that. They are the souls of dead people, unable&#x2014;or unwilling&#x2014;to shuffle off this mortal coil. Yurei are many things, but "friendly" isn't the first word that comes to mind. Not every yurei is dangerous, but they are all driven by emotions so uncontrollably powerful that they have taken on a life of their own: rage, sadness, devotion, a desire for revenge, or even the firm belief that they are still alive.<br><br>This book, the third in the authors' bestselling <i>Attack!</i> series, after <i>Yokai Attack!</i> and <i>Ninja Attack!</i> gives detailed information on 39 of the creepiest yurei stalking Japan, along with detailed histories and defensive tactics should you have the misfortune to encounter one.<br><br><b>Japanese ghosts include:</b><ul><li>Oiwa, The Horror of Yotsuya</li><li>Otsuyu, The Tale of the Peony Lantern</li><li>The Lady Rokujo, The Tale of Genji</li><li>Isora, Tales of Moonlight and Rain</li><li>Orui, The Depths of Kasane</li></ul><br><i>Book 3 of 3 in the Yokai Attack! series.

Ninja Attack! dispels stereotypes while filling in the real history of these infamous spies and assassins. Yokai Attack! catalogs demons and monsters, and Yurei Attack! focuses on gruesome ghost stories. Action-packed tales of vengeful spirits and shape-shifting badgers are accompanied by historical background, regional origins, and related trivia, while profiles of well-known ninja are interspersed with details of their daily lives, such as housing and food. Each book includes appendixes with recommended books, movies, and websites for further research. Gleefully gory manga-style illustrations in full color add to the creep-out factor of the texts, and eye-catching layouts with photographs and reproductions of woodblock prints make for a visually appealing reading experience. Japanese names and words are seamlessly integrated into the texts, with Japanese characters appearing alongside English translations and pronunciation guides. An engaging blend of information and entertainment, this trilogy is a fantastic reference for budding manga artists who want to incorporate Japanese legends into their own stories, or anyone who simply enjoys a good scare.-Allison Tran, Mission Viejo Library, CA&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

She is the author and illustrator of many award-winning books for children, including&nbsp;<i>Trucks, The Post Office Book,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>New Road. The Milk Makers</i>&nbsp;is her first book for Atheneum.Grade 2-4 Gibbons again makes a complex subject understandable to young children. Starting with the change of seasons, she discusses the weather typical of each season and how it develops, and then shows how the weather forecasters arrive at their short and long-range forecasts and make them available. She offers enough scientific vocabulary to delight the beginning scientists, e.g., anemometer and cumulonimbus clouds, while she relates the weather conditions to situations children will recognize, from thunderstorms to snow. Page design is cluttered, and the text appears in a smaller, less bold and hence less readable typeface than any of Gibbons' other recent books, which may put off less able readers. Informative printed explanations in many areas of the illustrations also are not easy to read. The illustrations, which include people of many races and both sexes, are naturalistic but simplified. Many books on weather are available for this age, but none relate it to the seasons as well as explain the system of weather stations and the jobs involved, and none have Gibbons' colorful, appealing illustrations.

But now, the unthinkable has happened&#x2014;Oleg, the boy he helped raise, has been arrested for killing a man. Harry can't believe that Oleg is a murderer, so he returns to hunt down the real killer.</p><p>Although he's off the police force, he still has a case to solve that will send him into the depths of the city&#x2019;s drug culture, where a shockingly deadly new street drug is gaining popularity. This most personal of investigations will force Harry to confront his past and the wrenching truth about Oleg and himself.</p></p><p><p><b>Amazon Exclusive: An Essay by Jo Nesb� on Harry Hole</b></p> <p>It is not easy to summarize the protagonist of the series in a few words, but here are some features of Harry&#x2019;s personality that are important to me when I write about him: he&#x2019;s the type of guy who is driven by his good side as well as his darker side. At times he believes in his role as law enforcer, at other times he doesn&#x2019;t. And occasionally he is so gripped by his emotions that they overwhelm his basic belief in the principles of a state governed by law. He hunts down criminals with such an intense hatred and finds revenge so hard to resist that at times he could be mistaken for the antagonists he is fighting. But at the same time he can feel empathy for, perhaps even a kinship with, the lawbreaker. Harry Hole is a hero with pronounced weaknesses. All interesting heroes have an Achilles heel, and in Harry&#x2019;s case, it is alcohol. </p> <p>Harry feels something akin to what the serial killer feels, the same tension and excitement, when he approaches a victim and the same anti-climax after the killer is caught. It is Harry&#x2019;s ambition to understand both love and evil. He is a passionate guy in all ways. And he is the type of man who has difficulties controlling his impulses. The fact that he cannot set limits permeates his drinking habits and his attitude to his job. He takes on cases and is swallowed up by them. It is the same with his relationships with women. I could have chosen to make Harry and Rakel live happily ever after and have children, but then we have a completely different person. I like the fact that he is in transit in his own life, as far as his emotions and his job are concerned. I'm often asked how much Harry and I have in common. I won't answer that in detail, but when you make a person a hero, as a writer you are bound to have at least a basic set of values, a goal, a need or a longing that you can relate to. </p><p>Jo Nesb�&#x2019;s books have sold more than eighteen million copies worldwide, and have been translated into forty-seven languages. His previous Harry Hole novels include <i>The Redbreast</i>, <i>Nemesis</i>, <i>The Devil&#x2019;s Star</i>, <i>The Snowman</i>, and <i>The Leopard</i>, and he is the author of <i>Headhunters</i> and several children&#x2019;s books.

That&#x2019;s what my father used to say, as we&#x2019;d stand on the edge of the bayou, fishing poles in hand. &#x201c;Life is like the water in that stream, always rushing past, always moving, different moment to moment.&#x201d;<br> <br>I thought this was his way of telling me to enjoy the stillness of those quiet moments we had together, shoulder to shoulder on the solid bank. But now, I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s what he meant at all. I think he was trying to warn me that life could change, just like that. That currents could shift, and suddenly I could be headed in a direction I never imagined.<br> <br>Well, the current has shifted, that&#x2019;s for sure, I think as I search my bedroom floor around open boxes and crumpled piles of newspaper.<br> <br>I call to Mom and my brother Micah. &#x201c;If anyone finds my keys or my red Converse shoe . . . I&#x2019;ll give you something, though I don&#x2019;t know what since I can&#x2019;t find anything. But it will be worth it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Across the room, my black Lab looks up with hopes that I&#x2019;m searching for his leash but then drops his head back down onto his dog bed as if I&#x2019;ve really let him down.<br> <br>&#x201c;When I get home,&#x201d; I say, as I pick up a sheet of bubble wrap.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe in here.&#x201d;<br> <br>It&#x2019;s Micah&#x2019;s voice but somewhat muffled.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>There aren&#x2019;t a lot of places he could be, so I head toward the living-dining-kitchen combination in the tiny cottage that has become our new home, sort of.<br> <br>Mom peers over her laptop from her perch at the kitchen counter. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t seen them,&#x201d; she says. Then when she looks at me adds, &#x201c;Um AJ, darling . . . you aren&#x2019;t wearing that, are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>She has that wrinkle in the space between her eyesbrows, as if the world is coming apart due to my wardrobe choices.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with what I&#x2019;m wearing?&#x201d; I glance down and bite the inside of my lip to hide the subtle pleasure that Mom has noticed. My look today was supposed to be a statement.<br> <br>My brother rises up from beneath the kitchen sink with a wrench in his hand and looks at me, then grins. &#x201c;Looks good to me. Or she will if she finds that other shoe.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mom frowns and then hops off the bar stool and grabs a potholder. She reaches into the oven and pulls out a pan of baked French toast&#x2014;my favorite breakfast. It&#x2019;s almost enough to make me feel guilty, except I know it&#x2019;s her attempt to make up for what happened last night.<br> <br>I glance down at my T-shirt that says &#x201c;Chuck &amp; Sons Auto Repair,&#x201d; my favorite jeans, one red Converse, and a gray sock on one foot. No one says it, but we all know the reason behind my clothing choice, or at least T-shirt choice.<br> <br>&#x201c;I just think, well, first impressions are important. This is a very nice school and it&#x2019;s a blessing you were admitted. And we aren&#x2019;t in Louisiana anymore,&#x201d; Mom says.<br> <br>Micah and I share an eye roll before he disappears back under the sink. I give Mom my widest fake smile. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m well aware we aren&#x2019;t in Louisiana. We&#x2019;re in the land of glitzy cowboy boots and perfect hair. I think my outfit will be a refreshing change.&#x201d;<br> <br>My brother chuckles and peers out from beneath the sink. &#x201c;Now, AJ. You can&#x2019;t go around talking like that. Who knows? Maybe you&#x2019;ll be the next country star now that we&#x2019;re here.&#x201d;<br> <br>All right, I have to admit, that makes me laugh, even though I&#x2019;m not exactly in the mood. I am so not country star material.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a lot more to Nashville than that,&#x201d; Mom says. &#x201c;And there are more opportunities here than back home. I know it&#x2019;s a big change, but it&#x2019;s for the best . . .&#x201d; Mom&#x2019;s voice drifts off, as if she&#x2019;s too tired to try convincing my brother and me.<br> <br>And she&#x2019;s got a lot of convincing to do, especially after the bomb she dropped last night. We had been here only a week and were just starting to get settled, when&#x2014;bam! just like that&#x2014;everything was changing again.<br> <br>Our video call with my other brother Noah, Micah&#x2019;s twin, had been going so well&#x2014;almost like old times&#x2014;even though Noah was just transferred to a military base in Germany. Noah was telling us about buying a pair of lederhosen and how his German friends had asked him to stop yodeling, since that was a Swiss thing, not Bavarian. Micah and I were telling Noah about the glitzy city people we&#x2019;d seen in downtown Nashville with their black glasses and designer jeans that even men wore so tight we called them painted jeans instead of skinny jeans. I noticed Mom getting all twitchy, and at first I brushed it off as her missing her son and being worried about the war zone he might be sent to. But her foot kept tapping, and she breathed in and out like someone about to dive underwater.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom, are you okay?&#x201d; I asked. My brothers, one beside me and one on the laptop screen, turned their attention toward her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Um . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Mom begins sentences with &#x201c;um&#x201d; when she isn&#x2019;t sure of what she&#x2019;s about to say. Our laughter and joking died down pretty fast, and we waited. I almost chuckled at the serious expression on �Noah&#x2019;s face as he leaned closer to the screen from the other side of the world. Then I saw Mom looking as nervous as she did when she told us we were moving to Nashville, and all humor completely dissolved. What was she about to tell us? The last serious news had changed our lives forever.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is something wrong?&#x201d; Noah asked via video call.<br> <br>&#x201c;Um, no, no, not at all. Nothing wrong.&#x201d;<br> <br>Not a good sign.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just . . . um . . . Micah and AJ already met my friend, Charles Worthington.&#x201d;<br> <br>She turned to the laptop screen and leaned in. &#x201c;Remember, my friend I told you about? He and his son helped unload some of the boxes over the weekend, and Charles gave me a lot of advice before we moved up.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;His son was super annoying,&#x201d; I said with a laugh, hoping to lighten the moment. But Micah gave me an elbow to the ribs, and Mom&#x2019;s face showed she most certainly didn&#x2019;t agree.<br> <br>&#x201c;They helped us out, and we should be thankful,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;<br> <br>I looked to Noah on the laptop screen for help and then blurted out as a joke, &#x201c;What, you aren&#x2019;t dating him, are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Mom&#x2019;s face flushed to crimson. The boys and I didn&#x2019;t move.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a little more than that. I know this will come as a shock, but we&#x2019;ve known each other since childhood. We were quite close until I went to college and married your father. A few months ago, he found me on Facebook when he heard I was moving back. All of it has been a shock to me, too.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A social media romance? Really?&#x201d; I heard myself say. Daddy would have told me to apologize for being disrespectful, but this wouldn&#x2019;t be going on if Dad were still here.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait, what is happening?&#x201d; Micah asked with a strong under�tone that helped Mom just blurt it out.<br> <br>&#x201c;Charles proposed. And I said yes, but we won&#x2019;t get married for a very long time, there&#x2019;s no rush, we have no plans yet. I still can&#x2019;t believe he asked me, or that I said yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>Our faces must have reflected all horror and no excitement whatsoever. That&#x2019;s how I felt, anyway.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing is going to change, so none of you have to worry.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing is going to change? Everything is&#x2014;&#x201d; I said, but Micah interrupted me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is this for real?&#x201d; Micah looked as confused as I felt.<br> <br>&#x201c;AJ. Micah,&#x201d; Noah said from the rectangular screen on the counter. His steady expression was a new one, probably honed from boot camp and a year as a soldier. &#x201c;This is where we say congratulations.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But, but&#x2014;Daddy hasn&#x2019;t been gone even two years,&#x201d; I said. Someone had to say it.<br> <br>I hoped one of my brothers would back me up. I knew they&#x2019;d hatched a plan to take care of Mom and me with Daddy gone. They were twin brothers who&#x2019;d never been apart. They always planned to join the Marines after two years of college, when they could go in as officers. They planned to finish getting their degrees after their service.<br> <br>Then after Dad, my brothers came up with a different plan. Micah stayed working at Daddy&#x2019;s old auto shop, even after the new owners took over, while Noah enlisted early and sent money home every month. College was no longer mentioned.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know how long he&#x2019;s been gone,&#x201d; Mom said in a whisper. &#x201c;I know every day that he&#x2019;s been gone.&#x201d;<br> <br>Our video call ended very soon after that. What more could be said? Just like that, Mom was ending everything. Life as we knew it was going to change, again.<br> <br>Now I watch Mom dish up thick squares of doughy baked French toast as the room fills with the scent of cinnamon and baking bread. My stomach growls. Mom has always been pretty; everyone says so. Her light hair and stunning blue eyes weren&#x2019;t passed on to me. I have Dad&#x2019;s chestnut hair and dark hazel eyes. In so many ways, I&#x2019;m nothing like her.<br> <br>I love my mom, but I don&#x2019;t understand her. With Daddy, everything was easy. We had the same sense of humor&#x2014;we&#x2019;d laugh at most everything&#x2014;and I knew his moods without having to ask or wonder. It hasn&#x2019;t been like that with Mom, and the idea of her marrying Charles makes the least sense of anything she&#x2019;s ever done.<br> <br>Charles is nothing like my father. Besides, any man who goes by the name of Charles, instead of Charlie or Chuck like Daddy, just isn&#x2019;t someone to know, let alone marry. For that matter, how could Mom marry anyone with the same name as Dad? Charles works in an air-�conditioned office and drives a luxury car; his hands look as if they&#x2019;ve never seen a callus or blister in his life.<br> <br>Dad&#x2019;s hands were rough with scars and calluses and stained from auto grease. Dad worked hard every day, yet always took time for the little things. He loved a good sunrise just a tad more than sunset. On road trips, we&#x2019;d play a game where we&#x2019;d try naming an engine size by the sound it made. And when we went out for peaches-and-cream snow cones, he savored each bite like a man enjoying his last meal. I&#x2019;m still convinced he had the best bedtime story voice of any father who ever lived&#x2014;even friends who stayed overnight agreed.<br> <br>So this morning I put on one of the T-shirts Dad ordered for his shop that says Chuck &amp; Sons Auto Repair. Wearing it makes him feel close again and shows where my allegiance remains.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, looking for these?&#x201d; Micah says after moving his toolbox off the counter. &#x201c;And didn&#x2019;t you say you&#x2019;d give something to the person who finds them?&#x201d;<br> <br>He holds up a set of keys and tosses them to me. I catch them easily and rub my thumb and index finger over the lucky silver dollar coin. The coin belonged to my grandfather, then passed to my father, then to Noah, who made it into a key chain. When Noah left for the military, he made me the caretaker of his beloved Jeep and the lucky key chain.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yep, I owe you, something great. Soon.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That doesn&#x2019;t sound very promising,&#x201d; Micah says.<br> <br>I catch Mom glance at my shirt again. Her expression says she&#x2019;s seeing something she wants to forget.<br> <br>Dad promised that when I turned eighteen, he&#x2019;d add &#x201c;Daughter&#x201d; to the shop name if I promised to do the great things he was sure God had planned for me. As a child, I&#x2019;d cry if anyone said a girl couldn&#x2019;t work in Daddy&#x2019;s auto shop. He called me his little grease monkey, and Mom was constantly upset at the dirt and oil on my pink frilly outfits. But in junior high, school and church activities filled my evenings and weekends, and I didn&#x2019;t have as much time to hand Dad tools or lean under a hood to study the twist of hoses and parts that wove an engine together. I just assumed no matter what I did or where I went, someday that name would be there: Chuck, Sons &amp; Daughter Auto Repair.<br> <br>I thought we had forever.<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to start school today,&#x201d; Mom says and sets two steaming plates on the counter for Micah and me. She gets some plastic flatware from the counter, since we haven&#x2019;t found some boxes quite yet. &#x201c;You can start on Monday instead.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well . . . I&#x2019;m a little concerned I&#x2019;m getting behind,&#x201d; I say as I move toward the gooey breakfast.<br> <br>My brother shakes his head to keep from laughing. School is the worst excuse I&#x2019;ve ever used, but after Mom tried to salvage last night with cheerful stories about how Charles promised to come over today to help unpack boxes and hook up our washer and dryer&#x2014;though my brother is perfectly capable and most certainly more experienced with a set of tools&#x2014;I knew I needed to get out of the house. That&#x2019;s when it became essential that I start school ASAP.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s very responsible of you,&#x201d; Mom says. She&#x2019;s trying to sound cheerful, but not succeeding. She pulls a jar of syrup out of a simmering pot on the stove and sets it down with the pot holder by our plates. Now I feel more stabs of guilt, but not enough to make me spend the day with Mom and Charles.<br> <br>I gobble down the French toast, good as it is, but with starting a new school, I need to get going. I need to get my class schedule and figure out where everything is before the campus is packed with tons of people all staring at the new girl. I&#x2019;ve never been the new girl before.<br> <br>I do another quick search through the house and find my missing Converse between Mom&#x2019;s art and history books, which are stacked precariously on the floor. A sense of being adrift washes over me. Mom would be leaving me in a different way than Daddy did. But she&#x2019;d be leaving me all the same. My brothers are twins, so they have each other for life. I&#x2019;m the one who seems lost, the misfit. And soon I won&#x2019;t have a home at all. Charles&#x2019;s house will never be home to me.<br> <br>Would Dad be sad knowing the girl he loved since their freshman year of college was marrying someone else so quickly? Would he feel sad that we sold his auto shop and moved to Tennessee, and all that was left were the T-shirts he bought us just months before he died?<br> <br>No matter where we live or what we do, I can&#x2019;t leave Daddy behind. I&#x2019;ll wear his shirt every day if that&#x2019;s what I need to do to show Mom, Charles, or anyone else that Daddy is with us always.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bye, Buck-boy. We&#x2019;ll walk tonight,&#x201d; I say, bending down to give my dog a good rub on the back that gets his tail wagging.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can come with you to meet your counselor. Charles isn&#x2019;t coming for a while,&#x201d; Mom says as I enter the kitchen on my way to the door.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay. Having my mom walk around with me, as a junior in high school . . . now that might make a bad first impression,&#x201d; I say with a smile. She nods and chuckles.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, no dents in Noah&#x2019;s baby,&#x201d; my brother says as he dishes up another helping of French toast.<br> <br>&#x201c;And don&#x2019;t you break any cars,&#x201d; I say, tossing back a line Dad used whenever he left the guys at his auto shop.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you know about it? Have fun at your fancy-schmancy school.&#x201d;<br> <br>Before I walk out the door, I go back and give Mom a quick hug. She clings a few seconds and grasps the back of my shirt like a life raft, and then breaks away.<br> <br>&#x201c;I love you, Sweetie. I will pray you have a good first day.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks, Mom, and thanks for the French toast. It was really good.&#x201d;<br> <br>The cold morning makes me shiver as I crunch across the frozen ground toward Noah&#x2019;s black Jeep. I&#x2019;m starting a new school in a new state in the middle of my junior year. It is also a Wednesday&#x2014;who starts a new high school on a Wednesday in February?<br> <br>I&#x2019;m usually as optimistic about life and tough times as Daddy was. He never seemed moved by adversity. So as I drive down the cold country road toward town, I conjure up some hop...</p><h2>Stormdancer: The Lotus War Book One (The Lotus War, 1)</h2><p><p>"What's that?

Stinking of open graves and burning hair, skin of polished midnight blue, eyes like funeral candles bathing the forest with guttering light. The club in its hands was twice as long as Yukiko was tall. One direct hit, and she would never see the samurai with the sea-green eyes again.<br>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s clever,&#x201d; she chided herself, &#x201c;thinking about boys at a time like this.&#x201d;<br>A spit-soaked roar pushed her hard in the chest, scattering a cloud of sparrows from the temple ruins at her back. Lightning licked the clouds, bathing the whole scene in fleeting, brilliant white: the endless wilds, the stranded sixteen-year-old girl, and the pit demon poised to cave in her skull.<br>Yukiko turned and ran.<br>Trees stretched in every direction, a steaming snarl of roots and undergrowth, stinking of green rot. Branches whipped her face and tore her clothes, rain and sweat slicked her skin. She touched the fox tattoo sleeving her right arm, tracing its nine tails in prayer. The demon behind her bellowed as she slipped away, over root and under branch, deeper into the suffocating heat.<br>She screamed for her father. For Kasumi or Akihito. For anybody.<br>And nobody came.<br>The trees erupted and toppled in front of her, cleft to the heartwood by an enormous ten-span sword. Another oni appeared through the shower of falling green, tombstone mask for a face, lips pierced with rusted iron rings. Yukiko dived sideways as the great sword swept overhead, clipping her braid. Strands of long, black hair drifted down to the dead leaves.<br>She was rolling to her feet when the oni snatched her up, quicker than flies, its awful grip making her cry out. She could read the blasphemous kanji symbols carved on its necklace, feel the heat gleaming from its flesh. The first oni arrived, bellowing in delight. Her captor opened its jaws, a black maggot tongue lolling between its teeth.<br>She drew her tanto and stabbed the demon&#x2019;s hand, burying six inches of folded steel to the hilt. Blood sprayed, black and boiling where it touched her skin. The oni roared and hurled her against a nearby cedar. Her skull cracked against the trunk and she crashed earthward, rag-doll limp, the bloody knife skittering from her grip. Darkness reached up to smother her and she desperately clawed it away.<br><i>Not like this.</i><br>The first demon&#x2019;s laughter reminded her of screaming children, burning on Guild pyres in the Market Square. Its wounded comrade growled in a dark, backward tongue, stalking forward and raising its sword to end her. Lightning glinted on the blade&#x2019;s edge, time slowing to a crawl as the blow began to fall. Yukiko thought of her father again, wishing for all the world she&#x2019;d done what she&#x2019;d been told for just once in her life.<br>Thunder cracked overhead. A white shape burst from the undergrowth and landed on the oni&#x2019;s back; a flurry of razors, broken blue sparks and beating wings. The demon shrieked as the beast tore into its shoulders, ripping mouthfuls of flesh with a blood-slick beak.<br>The first oni growled, swinging its war club in a broad, hissing arc. Their attacker sprang into the air, tiny whirlwinds of falling leaves and snow-white petals dancing in time to the thrashing of its wings. The demon&#x2019;s tetsubo slammed across its comrade&#x2019;s shoulders. Bone splintered under the war club&#x2019;s impact, the oni&#x2019;s spine shattering like dark, wet glass. It crumpled to the ground, its last breath spattered in steaming black across Yukiko&#x2019;s terrified face.<br>The beast landed off-balance, digging bloodstained claws into the earth.<br>The oni glanced at its companion&#x2019;s corpse, shifting the war club from one hand to the other. Howling a challenge, it lifted the weapon and charged. The pair collided, beast and demon, crashing earthward and tumbling about in a flurry of feathers, petals and screams.<br>Yukiko wiped at the sticky black in her eyes, tried to blink away her concussion. She could make out blurry shapes rolling in the fallen leaves, dark splashes staining the white azalea blossoms. She heard a crunch, a choking gurgle, and then a vast, empty silence.<br>She blinked into the gloom, pulse throbbing behind her eyes.<br>The beast emerged from the shadows, feathers stained black with blood. It stalked toward her and lowered its head, growl building in its throat. Yukiko groped toward her tanto, pawing through the muck and sodden leaves for the blade as her eyesight dimmed. The darkness beckoned, arms open wide, promising an end to all of her fear. To be with her brother again. To leave this dying island and its poisoned sky behind. To lie down and finally sleep after a decade of hiding who and what she was.<br>She closed her eyes and wished she were safe and warm at home, nestled in her blankets, the air tinged blue-black with the smoke from her father&#x2019;s pipe. The beast opened its beak and roared, a hurricane scream swallowing the light and memories.<br>Darkness fell completely.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2012 by Jay Kristoff<br></p><h2>Grimorium Verum: The True Grimoire</h2><p>The Grimorium Verum (sometimes spelled Grimoirium) is one of the most diabolical black magic works ever crafted within the occult.

Using a queer theory framework, Yergeau notes the stereotypes that deny autistic people their humanity and the chance to define themselves while also challenging cognitive studies scholarship and its reification of the neurological passivity of autistics. She also critiques early intensive behavioral interventions&#x2014;which have much in common with gay conversion therapy&#x2014;and questions the ableist privileging of intentionality and diplomacy in rhetorical traditions. Using storying as her method, she presents an alternative view of autistic rhetoricity by foregrounding the cunning rhetorical abilities of autistics and by framing autism as a narrative condition wherein autistics are the best-equipped people to define their experience. Contending that autism represents a queer way of being that simultaneously embraces and rejects the rhetorical, Yergeau shows how autistic people queer the lines of rhetoric, humanity, and agency. In so doing, she demonstrates how an autistic rhetoric requires the reconceptualization of rhetoric&#x2019;s very essence.</p><p>Melanie Yergeau is Assistant Professor of English Language and Literature at the University of Michigan."With incandescent wit and defiant exuberance, Melanie Yergeau employs her rhetorical scalpel to dismantle the clinical assumptions and cultural stereotypes that have been used to deny, dismiss, and obscure the basic humanity of autistic people for generations. This is not just a landmark book; it's a book that opens up a whole terrain of discourse informed by the insights of queer theory and the disability rights movement." -- Steve Silberman, author of, <i>NeuroTribes: The Legacy of Autism and the Future of Neurodiversity</i></p><h2>The Flintstones 1</h2><p>Hanna-Barbera has created some of the most recognizable animated characters of all time.

If using in a group, personal study is needed between meetings.</p><p>SEE THE BIG PICTURE OF YOUR LIFE. One of the great delights in reading a biography is to see the story of another person unfold; to experience that person&#39;s struggles to find meaning, and to become a creative, contributing human being. Think, then, of the value of watching your own life take shape in biographical form; of noting God&#39;s regular involvement, and of perceiving your purpose, strengths, and possibilities in light of your unfolding story. Practiced throughout history by such key figures as Augustine, Pascal, and C.S. Lewis, and regularly employed as a spiritual discipline by the Pilgrims, the writing of a spiritual autobiography can wield a pivotal influence in your life. Spiritual Autobiography brings this all-but-lost discipline to life for modern-day pilgrims. As you learn to discover, write, and tell your story-ups and downs included-you&#39;ll see God at work in your life. And when practiced in a group setting, the exercise of sharing your stories with one another takes on even greater value as you draw strength from one another&#39;s experiences and provide insight into where God seems to be leading each person in the group.RICHARD PEACE, Ph.D., holds the Robert Boyd Munger Chair as professor of evangelism and church renewal at Fuller Theological Seminary.

They did not know exactly why God had brought them there, what He wanted them to do, or even where the money to live on would come from. But He began opening doors, and people with questions about life's meaning began finding the way to their home.</p><p>Edith Schaeffer, wife of Dr. Francis Schaeffer, tells the remarkable story of how God led them step by step, as that one small chalet grew into a whole community. It took the name L'Abri (French for shelter). Day by day, God faithfully provided for their family, and eventually for the entire community.</p><p>The Schaeffers believed that truth must be demonstrated as well as debated. They wanted to show the world through the transformed lifestyle of a believing community that the personal-infinite God is really here in our generation. In a society losing the ability to distinguish between Christian and non-Christian values, truth and untruth, good and evil, L'Abri equipped people to make that distinction.</p><p>For more than thirty years, people have come to L'Abri from all walks of life and from many countries, searching for truth and reality. There they find someone who cares for them personally, who listens carefully to their questions, and who gives them answers based on an uncompromising commitment to Biblical truth. L'Abri now has branches in several other countries and has affected the lives of literally thousands of people around the world.</p></p><p><p><strong>EDITH SCHAEFFER </strong>is the widow of Francis Schaeffer, and with him co-founder of L'Abri Fellowship.

The conventional mainstream view of an overall linear progression in human history is no longer tenable; it is now clear that the ancients of 10,000 to 15,000 years ago were not primitives and we have much to learn from them. Based on the teachings of Sri Yukteswar, The Yugas by Joseph Selbie and David Steinmetz provides a perceptive analysis of history from the height of the last Satya Yuga (Spiritual Age) of circa 11,500 B.C. to our present age. Just as importantly, the authors discuss trends and developments that we may anticipate over the next 10,000 years as the cycle of the yugas comes full circle. The Yugas integrates and synthesizes disparate facts and apparent anomalies that are often ignored. This is a profound book on a profound subject. Intelligently written and fascinating, it provides new revelations on the unfolding of human potential over the course of millennia. (Robert M. Schoch, Ph.D., July 2010)<br><br>The Yugas is a great and important book that will undoubtedly revolutionize our view of history and how it plays out. Selbie and Steinmetz have done a terrific job in demonstrating the scientific evidence of rising and falling ages of man, as opposed to the linear development of civilization favored by most historians. Before reading The Yugas, I was familiar with Sri Yukteswar's and Paramhansa Yogananda's concept, on which the book is based. After reading The Yugas, I understood more deeply this concept's sometimes-surprising foundations in the past and its all-penetrating ramifications for the future. Reading this book was like being given a glimpse of the sweeping panorama of the ages. My mind shifted. My consciousness was transformed. I think The Yugas should be used as a textbook in universities. If you are at all interested in where humanity has been and where we are headed, I highly recommend that you read this book. (Richard Salva, author of The Reincarnation of Abraham Lincoln and Walking with William of Normandy, August 2010)<br><br>Move over Copernicus, another revolution is underway! The Yugas will not only change the way we look at history, it will change the way we see ourselves and the world around us. This is a wisdom whose time has come. The startling revelations and sweeping vision of Selbie and Steinmetz deliver a story so timeless it will challenge and inspire generations to come! Our forefathers etched the phrase Novus Ordo Seclorum (New Order of the Ages) on the Great Seal of our new nation, but few historians have understood its meaning. By resurrecting a lost knowledge, with exquisite and provocative detail, Selbie and Steinmetz unleash its full power and promise. The Yugas . . . I absolutely loved this book! (Walter Cruttenden, Founder of The Conference on Precession and Ancient Knowledge (CPAK), author of &#x201c;The Lost Star of Myth and Time&#x201d;)<br><br>Selbie and Steinmetz have produced a comprehensive and in-depth study of the yuga theory of Hindu and yogic thought. They have based their research upon the writings of Sri Yukteswar, the venerable guru of famed Yoga master Paramahansa Yogananda, and his profound insight. The book covers all aspects of the yugas, including the secret of what world age humanity currently resides in and what we can likely expect for the future. The book casts an important new light on the history and evolution of the human race and the mysteries of the great cycles of time that we must all honor. All those who want to understand our species and the hidden cosmic influences that govern our lives will benefit from its detailed examination. Those who study the book carefully will come away with a transformed vision of our world and its spiritual potentials. (David Frawley (Pandit Vamadeva Shastri), author of Astrology of the Seers and Yoga and Ayurveda, August 2010)<br><br>We moderns tend to believe we know more than those who have lived before us, especially those of earlier millennia. In its detailed research and fascinating revelations, this book pricks the bubble of that linear conceit with its wealth of extraordinary insights and evidence to the contrary. Here is proof once again that ancient wisdom and truth, though often overlooked or long forgotten, is never superceded. As we learn in this brilliant detective-like study that probes the arc of time, greater civilizations than ours have preceded and exceeded us, more advanced in spirituality as well as science, borne to higher awareness by a cyclical dance of cosmological forces. Contained in this new history of humankind is a divinely inspired examination of why we were as we were in ages past, why we are as we are in this ascending age of energy and understanding, and what we can anticipate about ourselves and our world in ages yet to come. Selbie and Steinmetz have given us a thesis that is uncompromisingly accurate in its chronicle of significant events and their correspondence to the yugas - cycles of human consciousness - in which they occurred. What emerges is an astonishing, compelling and altogether enlightened view of evolution itself. (James Surendra Conti, Manager, East-West Bookstore, August 2010)<br><br>If you're one of the people who has been asking yourself, "What's going on these days?" and not finding an answer that resonates with you, this is a book you will want to read and study. Based on the teachings of Sri Yukteswar and Paramhansa Yogananda, the book explains about the Yugas or ages the planet goes through every 24,000 years.<br><br>Not only does the book provide compelling evidence of the veracity of these cycles, it goes much further by telling us about our possible future cycles and how we and planet can be much different than we are today. The Yugas is comforting by giving meaning to today's events and it is intriguing by putting the world into a more easily understood evolutionary picture.<br><br>This is a don't miss read for anyone who wants a deeper understanding and appreciation of our past, present, and future.<br><br>A great gift for anyone on a spiritual path and for those who love history.<br><br>-Krysta Gibson, New Spirit journal; December, 2011</p><h2>How to Tan Animal Hides and How to Make High Quality Buckskin Clothing</h2><p>This is the book that is mentioned on the &#x201c;grandpappy.org&#x201d; Hard Times Survival website.<br>This book contains complete and detailed instructions on how to skin and butcher a wild animal. It also describes the process of creating delicious smoked meat that has a normal shelf life of approximately one year. The meat can be smoked over a normal fire but instructions and illustrations are also included on how to build a simple efficient smokehouse.<br>You will then be guided through the entire hide tanning process, step by step.<br> Next you will be shown how to take specific measurements at exact locations on the human body so you can create your own clothing patterns at home. You will then be shown how to combine your own homemade clothing patterns with your own tanned animal hides so that you can make your own high quality underwear, shirts, pants, skirts, dresses, jackets, ponchos, caps, and moccasins.<br>This book also contains instructions on how to make ropes, whips, slings, and arrows. Also included are detailed instructions on how to make parchment, homemade ink, and a feather pen.<br>In summary, this book will show you how to use almost every part of a wild game animal so that nothing of any real practical value is wasted.<br>This book uses pictures and hand drawn sketches depending on which one best illustrates the concept being discussed. For example, a neatly drawn sketch of a sewing stitch is far superior to a picture of that same sewing stitch because the hand drawn sketch can show precise details that would not be clearly visible in a picture.<br>If you are a hunter and you do not currently save and process the hides of the wild game animals that your family eats, then this book will clearly explain how to accomplish this task so that you can begin to strategically use a part of the animals that you have been throwing away.<br>If you are currently experiencing hard times and you are eating a lot of wild game meat, then this book will explain how to convert the hides of those animals into soft smooth buckskins that can be used to make high quality clothing for your family that will last for many, many years.<br>In my opinion, every one of the practical skills that are described in this book could be of timeless value to you and to your descendants.</p><p>Robert Wayne Atkins, P.E.

He wants a friend more than anything.</p> <p>One day Fergus finds treasure on the beach: a beautiful fur blanket hidden in the rocks. But Fergus doesn't know that his treasure belongs to someone else -- a selkie girl has lost her seal skin and can't go home to the sea without it.</p> <p>Will Fergus give his new friend what she needs, and risk being lonely again?</p> <p>This is a lovely retelling of the traditional Scottish folk tale of the selkie (a seal who can become human) adapted for a young audience. Beautifully written by storyteller and selkie storyteller Janis Mackay, the tale is accompanied by stunning illustrations by Ruchi Mhasane.</p> <p><em>The Selkie Girl</em> is one of the first titles released in the <em>Picture Kelpies: Traditional Scottish Tales</em> range of picture books that bring classic Scottish folk and fairy tales to life for young children."</p></p><p>Janis Mackay currently lives in Edinburgh, where she teaches creative writing and works as a writer and storyteller. She is the author of several novels for older children including the Magnus Fin trilogy, and The Accidental Time Traveller, winner of a Scottish Children&#39;s Book Award. Ruchi Mhasane has a masters degree in children&#39;s book illustration from Cambridge School of Art. She currently lives in India, where she grew up.K-Gr 2&#x2014;In this retelling about the traditional Scottish selkie, a half-human, half-seal creature, Fergus and his father live alone by the sea. A widower trying to provide for his son, the fisherman worries about the increasingly small number of fish he is able to catch each day. Fergus spends most of his time alone, wishing for a friend and looking for treasures on the beach. During one foray he finds a silky fur flecked with silver. "Treasure!" he cries. In his excitement, Fergus doesn't notice a girl waving at him from down the beach. She is a selkie and needs her skin to return to the sea. Later, Shonagh finds the boy and demands her skin back. Fergus's great desire for a friend causes him to strike a bargain. If Shonagh will spend seven days with him, he will return it. They enjoy each other's company, playing tag and flying kites. The selkie girl teaches Fergus how to catch fish with his bare hands, and his father is thrilled with the bounty the boy brings home. On the seventh day, the skin is returned so Shonagh can rejoin her mother in the sea. The sumptuous watercolor illustrations are full bleed and beautifully detailed. Blues, greens, and browns are used in varying degrees to richly portray the ocean and shore. VERDICT This is a vibrant addition for folklore collections.&#x2014;Sara-Jo Lupo Sites, George F.

Our ways are not your ways, and there shall be to you many strange things.&#x2019;</p><p>Earnest and naive solicitor Jonathan Harker travels to Transylvania to organise the estate of the infamous Count Dracula at his crumbling castle in the ominous Carpathian Mountains. Through notes and diary entries, Harker keeps track of the horrors and terrors that beset him at the castle, telling his fianc� Mina of the Count&#x2019;s supernatural powers and his own imprisonment. Although Harker eventually manages to escape and reunite with Mina, his experiences have led to a mental breakdown of sorts.</p><p>Meanwhile in England, Mina&#x2019;s friend Lucy has been bitten and begins to turn into a vampire. With the help of Professor Van Helsing, a previous suitor of Lucy&#x2019;s, Seward, and Lucy&#x2019;s fianc� Holmwood attempt to thwart Count Dracula and his attempts on Lucy and consequently Mina&#x2019;s life.</p><p>Arguably the most enduring Gothic novel of the 19th Century, Bram Stoker&#x2019;s Dracula is as chilling today in its depiction of the vampire world and its exploration of Victorian values as it was at its time of publication.</p></p><p><i>Dracula</i> is one of the few horror books to be honored by inclusion in the Norton Critical Edition series. (The others are <i>Frankenstein,</i> <i>The Turn of the Screw,</i> <i>Heart of Darkness,</i> <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray,</i> and <i>The Metamorphosis.</i>) This 100th-anniversary edition includes not only the complete authoritative text of the novel with illuminating footnotes, but also four contextual essays, five reviews from the time of publication, five articles on dramatic and film variations, and seven selections from literary and academic criticism. Nina Auerbach of the University of Pennsylvania (author of <i>Our Vampires, Ourselves</i>) and horror scholar David J. Skal (author of <i>Hollywood Gothic</i>, <i>The Monster Show</i>, and <i>Screams of Reason</i>) are the editors of the volume. Especially fascinating are excerpts from materials that Bram Stoker consulted in his research for the book, and his working papers over the several years he was composing it.

For years, new and experienced elementary school teachers alike have extolled the virtues of Picture-Perfect Science Lessons the expertly combined appeal of children s picture books with Standards-based science content. The award-winning, bestselling book presents ready-to-teach lessons, complete with student pages and assessments, that use high-quality fiction and nonfiction picture books to guide hands-on science inquiry. This newly revised and expanded edition of Picture-Perfect Science Lessons manages to surpass the original. Classroom veterans Karen Ansberry and Emily Morgan, who also coach teachers through nationwide workshops, know elementary educators are usually crunched for science instructional time and could often use refresher explanations of scientific concepts. So the authors added comprehensive background notes to each chapter and included new reading strategies. They still show you exactly how to combine science and reading in a natural way with classroom-tested lessons in physical science, life science, and Earth and space science. And now they offer five brand-new lessons Batteries Included, The Secrets of Flight, Down the Drain, If I Built a Car, and Bugs! bringing the total to 25. As always, the appropriate National Science Education Standards are clearly identified throughout. Picture-Perfect Science Lessons draws on such diverse and engaging books as Dr. Xargle s Book of Earthlets, A House for Hermit Crab, Rice Is Life, Oil Spill!, Sheep in a Jeep, and Weird Friends: Unlikely Allies in the Animal Kingdom. As a result, both reluctant scientists and struggling readers will quickly find themselves absorbed in scientific discovery. You ll love how effective this book is, and your students will love learning about science.</p><p><b>Karen Ansberry</b> is a former classroom teacher who understands that teachers are crunched for time and need high-interest, ready-to-use lessons that integrate literature, reading strategies, and science. After graduating from Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio with a bachelor's degree in biology, she completed an internship in the Cincinnati Zoo's education department. After earning a Master of Arts in teaching from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, she began teaching fifth and sixth grade science at Mason City Schools, in Mason, Ohio.Winner of 2011 Bronze EXCEL Award from Association Media &amp; Publishing --Association Media &amp; Publishing<br><br>I met Emily Morgan while we were OSCI trained in Columbus, OH a few years ago. She introduced me to her book and I thought it was wonderful. The lessons follow the 5 E s Model that allows students to EXPLORE, EXPLORE, EXPLORE. The inquiry method of teaching is so important when teaching children science. I use lessons from the Picture Perfect Science in my 6th grade classes too and the workshops that I facilitate the OPFERST classes at Youngstown State University. The teachers in the workshop are so impressed with the lessons that we have ordered both books for over 70 teacher participants. Many teachers are used to not teaching much science or teach it as a reading lesson. After using Picture Perfect Science lessons in the workshop, most teachers were excited about teaching science and cannot wait to get back to the classroom to teach using the 5 E s Model. Integrating Picture Books is a great way to integrate Language Arts into Science while using inquiry. --Reviewed by: Sharon Ragan (Youngstown, OH) on July 2, 2008<br><br>Picture-Perfect Science Lessons is an explanation and guide for using picture books and other children s literature as a way to teach science. The book begins by outlining an argument for using such literature in science and provides best practice methods for reading picture books aloud to children. The first chapter defines a picture book as being ...unique to children s literature as they are defined by format rather than content. That is, they are books in which the illustrations are of equal importance as or more important than the text in the creation of meaning (Strickland and Morrow 2000). Picture books tend to capture the interest of children for longer periods of time and lend themselves to comprehension strategy practice. The book gave four research-based arguments for using picture books. First, they give context for concepts. Rather than having student memorize lists of facts, books give a real-life context in which new concepts can better be learned and observed. Second, picture books provide a greater depth of coverage. Unlike textbooks which often give broad coverage on many topics, picture books allow for in-depth coverage on one topic. Third, research shows that children showed great gains in literacy skills when introduced to children s literature and literacy instruction in the science program. Their attitude towards science also improved. Finally, using picture books within the science curriculum provided opportunities to correct science misconceptions. Repetition of the correct concept by reading several books, doing a number of experiments, and inviting scientists to the classroom can facilitate a conceptual change in children (Miller, Steiner, and Larson 1996). The second chapter gave tips for reading aloud and reading comprehension strategies. The authors also listed tools for improving reading comprehension including anticipation guides, visual representations, rereading, stop and jot, think-pair-share, and word sorts. The third and fourth chapters discussed using an inquiry model and leading children through prediction, inferring, and questioning. The authors introduce us to the BSCS Instruction Model (Biological Sciences Curriculum Study) and the 5E model. The 5E model is Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate and Evaluate. The purpose of the Engage stage is to capture students attention. The Explore stage provides opportunities for students to engage in activities, giving them concrete experiences, concepts and skills. In the Explain stage, students are given a chance to put their ideas into their own words, clarifying the concepts. This gives the teacher a checkpoint to assess student understanding.

At the evaluate stage, the teacher is able to assess student s understanding and give opportunity for students to self-evaluate. The remainder of the book lays out each chapter as a lesson plan, including goals, objectives, all required materials, activities, questions and a rubric for assessment. Each chapter provides the worksheets needed for the activities and lays out each lesson according to the 5E model. I would highly recommend this book for its many strategies and usability. --Reviewed by: Melanie Zook on May 5, 2008</p><h2>Breaking Out of the Box: Adventure-Based Field Instruction</h2><p>Moving from the classroom to the field is often a daunting transition for social work students.

He is also brutally honest in his criticism of a NASA leadership whose bungling would precipitate the Challenger disaster -- killing four members of his group. A hilarious, heartfelt story of life in all its fateful uncertainty, <i>Riding Rockets</i> will resonate long after the call of "Wheel stop."</p><p>Upon his graduation from West Point in 1967, <b>Mike Mullane</b> was commissioned in the USAF. He flew 134 combat missions in Vietnam. Selected in the first group of space shuttle astronauts, he completed three space missions. He lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with his wife, Donna, and enjoys the challenge of Colorado's fourteen-thousand-foot peaks -- six climbed, forty-seven to go. He is also an acclaimed motivational speaker.<br><br>For more information visit www.MikeMullane.com.With a testosterone-fueled swagger and a keen eye for particulars, Mullane takes readers into the high-intensity, high-stress world of the shuttle astronaut in this rough-hewn yet charming yarn of low-rent antics, bureaucratic insanity and transcendent beauty. Mullane opens this tale face down on a doctor's table awaiting a colorectal exam that will determine his fitness for astronaut training. "I was determined when the NASA proctologist looked up my ass, he would see pipes so dazzling he would ask the nurse to get his sunglasses," he writes, setting the tone for the crude and often hilarious story that follows. Chosen as a trainee in 1978, Mullane, a Vietnam vet, quickly finds himself at odds with the buttoned-up post-Apollo NASA world of scientists, technocrats and civilian astronauts he describes as "tree-huggers, dolphin friendly fish eaters, vegetarians, and subscribers to the <i>New York Times.</i>" He holds female astronauts in special disregard, though he later grudgingly acknowledges the achievement and heroism of both the civilians and women. The book hits its stride with Mullane's space adventures: a difficult takeoff, the shift into zero gravity, his first view of the Earth from space: "To say the view was overwhelmingly beautiful would be an insult to God." <i>(Feb. 14)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But who was the man behind the legend? Was he truly a monster, or a capable ruler cursed by bad luck? In this new book bestselling historian Marc Morris draws on contemporary chronicles and the king's own letters to bring the real King John vividly to life.<br><br> John was dynamic, inventive and relentless, but also a figure with terrible flaws. In two interwoven stories, we see how he went from being a youngest son with limited prospects to the ruler of the greatest dominion in Europe, an empire that stretched from the Scottish border to the Pyrenees. His rise to power involved treachery, rebellion and murder. His reign saw oppression on an almost unprecedented scale: former friends hounded into exile and oblivion; Wales, Scotland and Ireland invaded; the greatest level of financial exploitation since the Norman Conquest. A quarrel with the pope led to the king being excommunicated and England being placed under Interdict. John's tyrannical rule climaxed in conspiracy and revolt, and his leading subjects famously forced him to issue Magna Carta, a document binding him and his successors to behave better in future. The king's rejection of the charter led to civil war and foreign invasion, bringing his life to a disastrous close.<br><br> Authoritative and dramatic, Marc Morris's <em>King John</em> offers a compelling portrait of an extraordinary man, whose reign marked a momentous turning point in the history of Britain and Europe. 16 pages of color and B&amp;W illustrations</p><p>Marc Morris is a historian and broadcaster specializing in the Middle Ages.

She&#x2019;s traded in her law degree for her old private investigating license, struggling to keep Mars Investigations afloat on the scant cash earned by catching cheating spouses until she can score her first big case.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now it&#x2019;s spring break, and college students descend on Neptune, transforming the beaches and boardwalks into a frenzied, week-long rave. When a girl disappears from a party, Veronica is called in to investigate. But this is no simple missing person&#x2019;s case; the house the girl vanished from belongs to a man with serious criminal ties, and soon Veronica is plunged into a dangerous underworld of drugs and organized crime. And when a major break in the investigation has a shocking connection to Veronica&#x2019;s past, the case hits closer to home than she ever imagined.<br>&nbsp;<br>In <i>Veronica Mars</i>, Rob Thomas has created a groundbreaking female detective who&#x2019;s part Phillip Marlowe, part Nancy Drew, and all snark.

He lives in Austin with his wife and two children. He hasn&#x2019;t fully recovered from Ray Allen&#x2019;s three-pointer in Game 6 of the 2013 NBA Finals.<br><b>Jennifer Graham</b> <br><br>Jennifer Graham graduated from Reed College and received her MFA from the University of Texas at Austin. Her short stories have appeared in <i>The Seattle</i> <i>Review </i>and <i>Zahir</i>. She currently lives in Austin with her husband.CHAPTER TWO<br> &nbsp;<br> Traffic was already a nightmare by the time Veronica dropped her dad off at home and headed back out toward Mars Inves�tigations. Spring break had descended on Neptune in all its bacchanalian glory, and even though the worst of it choked the beaches and boardwalks, the party had spread inland, creeping up through the commercial districts and the historic downtown blocks. The drunk and disoriented glutted the bars, restaurants, and shops all over town, even at noon on a Monday. It&#x2019;d already been going on for more than a week, and it wouldn&#x2019;t slow up until mid�-April&#x2014;there were hundreds of colleges within driving distance, each with its own spring break dates.<br> &nbsp;<br> Veronica glanced in her rearview mirror. Traffic stretched as far as she could see, motionless in the sun. The sidewalks were crawling with undergrads, shouting at their friends, lifting glass bottles in impromptu toasts. Apparently Neptune&#x2019;s public consumption laws were being selectively enforced. But that was par for the course during the three-�week spring break season&#x2014;money talked in Neptune, and no one heard it louder or clearer than Sheriff Dan Lamb. He spent most of the year chasing &#x201c;undesirables&#x201d; (translation: anyone flirting with the poverty line) off the streets, only to turn a blind eye to binge�-drinking eighteen�-year�-olds descending en masse.<br> &nbsp;<br> Someone laid on his horn. A girl with feather hair extensions leaned down into the gutter to vomit, then straightened up and kept walking as if nothing had happened. A cluster of bikini�-clad girls on roller skates tripped laughing across the road while several boys stood on the sidewalk filming them with their cell phones. She sighed and fiddled with the radio dial. She&#x2019;d let Keith man the stations on the way home and now Blue �yster Cult blared from the speakers, the cowbell ringing loud and proud. <i>Five hundred stations on this thing and he went straight to 1976. There&#x2019;s no help for some people.</i> She played idly with the controls, looking for something to pass the time.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I can tell you one thing: I wouldn&#x2019;t let <i>my</i> daughter go to Neptune for spring break.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Veronica paused. She knew that voice right away: Trish Turley, big, blond, and Texan, sounded like an avenging fury cutting across the airwaves. Her TV show ran daily on CNN, and Neptune&#x2019;s local talk radio streamed the audio.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I mean, the place is just a pressure cooker of hormones, drugs, and alcohol. Kids these days aren&#x2019;t taught to respect their own limits. And have you seen the way these girls act?&#x201d; You could practically see Trish Turley shaking her head in approbation. &#x201c;All you have to do is look up Neptune in your World Wide Web and you&#x2019;ll find video upon video of them showing their breasts for free beer. And then we&#x2019;re shocked when someone gets hurt.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Ah, the twin pillars of outrage journalism: slut shaming and victim blaming. Trish Turley liked to call herself a &#x201c;victim&#x2019;s rights&#x201d; advocate, but anytime she could turn an eye on the general decay of society (as witnessed through WASP�-colored glasses), she made sure to cover all the bases. The corruption of youth? Check. Amoral decadence? Check. Missing white girl? Yahtzee.<br> &nbsp;<br> But even Veronica had to admit that it was disturbing how little difference eighteen�-year�-old Hayley Dewalt&#x2019;s disappearance had made to the festivities. The news had hit that weekend: Hayley, down with friends from UC Berkeley, had been missing for almost a week. But you&#x2019;d never have guessed it from the air of celebration hanging over the town. The bass pounded on and the beer still flowed freely. She wasn&#x2019;t sure what the reaction to one of their own vanishing into thin air should be, but the spring breakers&#x2019; blind and blissful determination to carry on as if nothing bad could happen to them surprised even her. She wasn&#x2019;t sure she&#x2019;d ever had that invincible, indestructible air, even when she&#x2019;d been younger.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And then there&#x2019;s this Keystone Kop sheriff.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> That caught her attention. She turned the radio up a little.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This Dan Lamb character? What a joker. Who goes on national TV in the post&#x2013;Natalee Holloway world to say we shouldn&#x2019;t worry about a missing teenaged girl? I hope that the Dewalt family has a good lawyer on the books. A lawsuit might just get Lamb&#x2019;s attention.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A slow smile spread over Veronica&#x2019;s face. <i>Trish, Trish, Trish. We have so little in common, and yet suddenly I have a powerful urge to kiss you.</i> She&#x2019;d been watching Lamb for the past few months, waiting for any opportunity to nail him to the wall&#x2014;but if he kept this up, he&#x2019;d do it himself.<br> &nbsp;<br> The video Veronica had sent to TMZ had started the ball rolling, of course. She&#x2019;d caught Lamb on tape talking about the Bonnie DeVille murder case, saying, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care if Logan Echolls ain&#x2019;t the guy. America thinks he&#x2019;s guilty and that&#x2019;s good enough for me.&#x201d; That little snippet had hit the airwaves hard. Lamb had an election in eight months, and for the first time his reelection was a less�-than�-sure bet. The town&#x2019;s wealthiest residents still supported him&#x2014;Lamb looked after their interests, after all&#x2014;but his approval ratings had taken a nosedive in the past few months.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s listen to this guy&#x2019;s statement when the press finally cornered him Friday afternoon,&#x201d; Turley continued.<br> &nbsp;<br> The sound quality changed&#x2014;wind crackled against a cheap recorder. Sheriff Dan Lamb&#x2019;s voice was calm, but there was no mistaking the hint of impatience.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We are definitely on the lookout for Miss Dewalt, but as far as we can tell there&#x2019;s no evidence of foul play. At this time we are not conducting a criminal investigation, nor are we conducting a missing person search. Look,&#x201d; he said, his voice rising over the sudden murmur of a crowd. &#x201c;This happens every year. Kids get separated from their friends. They overindulge, they forget to check in, and everyone panics. Then they turn up a few days later, safe and sound. There&#x2019;s absolutely no safety problem here in Neptune.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Some part of Lamb must have realized it was a bad idea to answer questions off the cuff about a missing girl, but he had a pathological inability to turn down media attention. It clearly ran in the family. His brother, Don&#x2014;who&#x2019;d been the sheriff when Veronica had been in high school&#x2014;had been cut from the same cloth. And now Lamb&#x2019;s sound bites had been playing on repeat through the weekend, making Neptune&#x2019;s Sheriff&#x2019;s Department look cavalier and incompetent.<br> &nbsp;<br> The traffic started to move again. Veronica eased the car forward, narrowly missing two girls who stopped in the middle of the street to light each other&#x2019;s cigarettes. They both held up their middle fingers in perfect unison. Veronica cheerfully flipped them off in return, then took a right toward Neptune&#x2019;s Warehouse District.<br> &nbsp;<br> The redbrick building that housed Mars Investigations had been a brewery at the turn of the twentieth century, but in the past decade it&#x2019;d been subdivided into lofts and offices. Veronica was still getting used to it&#x2014;back when she&#x2019;d worked as her dad&#x2019;s receptionist in high school, the office had been in a modest commercial district, surrounded by bookstores and Chinese takeout joints. But when the &#x2019;09er, an exclusive new nightclub, opened just down the street from their old location, rent had shot through the roof, effectively gentrifying her dad&#x2019;s one�-man operation right out of the neighborhood. Rent here was more manageable.<br> &nbsp;<br> Though if she didn&#x2019;t land a good case soon, it still wouldn&#x2019;t be manageable enough.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Mars Investigations logo&#x2014;a modified Eye of Providence with horizontal lines across the triangle&#x2014;hung over the door to the walk�-up, etched in glass. Veronica climbed the creaking stairs. The place had an old�-building smell, dry and dusty and warm. At the top of the landing she pushed through the double doors to the outer office.<br> &nbsp;<br> The room was neat but shabby. Light streamed through the blinds, falling in long bars across the floor. The walls were a deep taupe shade that took on a brooding tone in the shadows&#x2014;the color had been picked for its cheapness rather than aesthetic qualities. A thrift�-store sofa sat beneath the hallway windows, a dusty rubber plant in the corner. Across from their color copier, a fish tank burbled quietly.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cindy Mackenzie sat at the reception desk, watching Trish Turley on the biggest of the three monitors on her desk. Mac&#x2019;s short shock of brown hair fell over one eye, and a slouchy gray sweater hung off one narrow shoulder. Veronica and Mac had been friends since their junior year at Neptune High. They&#x2019;d been drawn together by Mac&#x2019;s hacking skills, but it was their mutual misanthropy that had sealed the deal.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mac looked up as Veronica shrugged out of her leather jacket, hanging it on a coat rack by the door. &#x201c;Morning, boss.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Boss?&#x201d; Veronica widened her eyes. &#x201c;Did I start <i>paying</i> you?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; Mac said, her eyes darting back to her screen. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s also not really morning.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I think thousands of spring breakers would disagree with you,&#x201d; Veronica said. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Touch�.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A few months earlier, Mac had left a secure job at Kane Software to work with Veronica at Mars Investigations. The pay at Kane had been great, but the job itself was a little too bland for a self�-proclaimed digital outlaw. Finding new and creative ways to dig up dirt for Veronica&#x2019;s clients was much more her speed. The title they&#x2019;d been tossing around had been &#x201c;technical analyst,&#x201d; but at this point it seemed mostly philosophical&#x2014;the caseload had been dry for weeks, and the few gigs they&#x2019;d had had been completely lowbrow. Cheating spouses, fraudulent insurance claims, due�-diligence investigations. Things Veronica could easily have managed by herself.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Did you see Neptune made the news?&#x201d; Mac nodded at her monitor and turned up the volume. Turley&#x2019;s enormous hair filled the better part of the screen, a stiff blond bouffant that didn&#x2019;t budge when she moved. The woman&#x2019;s eyes blazed as she spoke, enunciating every word with righteous indignation.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to encourage anyone who can to donate to the Find Hayley Fund. If this sheriff&#x2019;s not going to find her, it&#x2019;s up to us, viewers.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The fund is up to nearly four hundred thousand dollars, and it&#x2019;s only been open a few days,&#x201d; Mac said.<br> &nbsp;<br> Veronica whistled. &#x201c;Well, Trish Turley may be an opportunistic parasite thriving off our broken criminal justice system. But she sure can throw a booster sale.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She sank down into the threadbare couch and rested her head back against the wall. &#x201c;Next year, let&#x2019;s go somewhere for spring break, Mac. Anywhere college kids aren&#x2019;t puking. Someplace with no booze.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Next year, spring break in Tehran. I&#x2019;m booking it now,&#x201d; Mac said, not even looking up from her computer. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s your dad?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Good. The doc says just a few more weeks and he can do some light�-duty work. He can&#x2019;t wait to get back in here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Catastrophic injuries are wasted on some people.&#x201d; Mac shook her head. &#x201c;If I&#x2019;d ruptured every single one of my organs, I&#x2019;d be milking it for everything it was worth.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Veronica stared at a long crack that zigzagged like a constellation across the ceiling. She distantly realized she&#x2019;d have to call the landlord about it. But talking to Sven about the<br> shitty roof would necessitate talking to Sven about the rent, which was three days late. She exhaled loudly and closed her eyes.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You may have noticed that another Friday has come and gone, and your bank balance is nonetheless unchanged,&#x201d; she started.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mac cut her off. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, Veronica. I know things have been tight.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Veronica opened her eyes and smiled weakly. &#x201c;Mac, I&#x2019;m so sorry. This isn&#x2019;t how I imagined any of this.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; Mac said chidingly. &#x201c;We both knew there was a chance it wouldn&#x2019;t work. Look, I&#x2019;ve already started looking around for another paying gig. Just to cover my bills, you know? And I can still come in as, like, a consultant next time you need me.&#x201d; She gave a lopsided grin. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Of course, my prices are double for consulting.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; Veronica smiled, but inside she was cringing. It wasn&#x2019;t just that she was letting Mac down, but on top of that she worried there&#x2019;d never be another case complicated enough to require Mac&#x2019;s technical savvy. She&#x2019;d worked for her dad long enough to know the truth about the PI game&#x2014;for every high�-profile case, for every Sherlock-�level puzzle, there were a hundred boring, petty cases. And she was barely scoring the latter.<br> &nbsp;<br> Was this really what she&#x2019;d chosen? Over New York, over a corporate law job where she&#x2019;d be pulling in six figures&#x2014;<i>before</i> bonus time? Well, at this rate it wouldn&#x2019;t last much longer. Unless something changed, she&#x2019;d bring Mars Investigations&#x2014;and all her father&#x2019;s work&#x2014;crashing down around her.<br> &nbsp;<br> As if on cue, the door swung open. In walked a woman with chestnut curls flaring out from high cheekbones and a light wool suit tailored to fit her ample curves. Her stiletto heels rang sharply against the floor as she strode forward. She moved with heavy, almost sultry grace. Her dark, velvety eyes made a circuit of the room before finally coming to rest on the couch where Veronica sat.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking for Keith Mars,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I need his help.&#x201d;</p><h2>Falcon Of Sparta</h2><p>Light wear to cover.

It includes some of the latest developments in the field, and some very useful computer software&#x2014;developed by the author&#x2014;with detailed instructions. <b> </b> Specific chapter topics include stresses and strains in flexible pavements, stresses and deflections in rigid pavements, traffic loading and volume, material characterization, drainage design, pavement performance, reliability, flexible pavement design, rigid pavement design, design of overlays, theory of viscoelasticity, theory of elastic layer systems, Superpave, pavement management systems, and an introduction to the 2002 Pavement Design Guide. <b> </b> For practicing engineers in the design of pavements and raft foundations. </p></p><p>This text/software package explores the structural analysis and design of highway pavements -- focusing on the mechanistic-empirical design procedures rather than the purely empirical methods.<p> Focusing on mechanistic-empirical design procedures, this volume presents a comprehensive exploration of the structural analysis and design of highway pavements. </p> <p> Although the current Pavement Design Guide adopted by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) is mainly empirical, a new guide based on mechanistic-empirical procedures will be published and implemented in the very near future. This book will provide the fundamental background to a full understanding of these sophisticated procedures. </p> <p> The accompanying CD contains a Windows software called KENPAVE, which can be run on any personal computer with Windows 95 or higher. In addition to several input and graphics programs, KENPAVE consists of two well-known computer programs for pavement analysis and design: </p> <ul> <li>The <b>KENLAYER</b> program for flexible pavements can be applied to a multilayered system under stationary or moving multiple wheel loads with each layer being linear elastic, nonlinear elastic, or viscoelastic.</li> <li>The <b>KENSLABS</b> program for rigid pavements can be applied to multiple slabs fully or partially supported on a liquid, solid, or layered foundation with moment or shear transfer across joints.</li> </ul> <p> Both programs can perform damage analysis by dividing a year into a number of periods, each subjected to different combinations of singleand multiple-axle loads. </p> <p> Structural and geotechnical engineers can also benefit from this book by applying KENPAVE to the design of raft foundations. In addition to vertical loads, the foundation slab can be subjected to moments in two directions, such as those imposed by retaining walls, and the contours of positive and negative moments can be plotted. This information will be useful to determine the length and amount of reinforcements required. </p></p><h2>Languages of the World: An Introduction</h2><p>What do all human languages have in common and in what ways are they different?

How did the collection, processing, and communication of information come to play an increasingly important role in advanced industrial countries relative to the roles of matter and energy? And why is this change recent&#x2015;or is it?</p><p>James Beniger traces the origin of the Information Society to major economic and business crises of the past century. In the United States, applications of steam power in the early 1800s brought a dramatic rise in the speed, volume, and complexity of industrial processes, making them difficult to control. Scores of problems arose: fatal train wrecks, misplacement of freight cars for months at a time, loss of shipments, inability to maintain high rates of inventory turnover. Inevitably the Industrial Revolution, with its ballooning use of energy to drive material processes, required a corresponding growth in the exploitation of information: the Control Revolution.</p><p>Between the 1840s and the 1920s came most of the important information-processing and communication technologies still in use today: telegraphy, modern bureaucracy, rotary power printing, the postage stamp, paper money, typewriter, telephone, punch-card processing, motion pictures, radio, and television. Beniger shows that more recent developments in microprocessors, computers, and telecommunications are only a smooth continuation of this Control Revolution. Along the way he touches on many fascinating topics: why breakfast was invented, how trademarks came to be worth more than the companies that own them, why some employees wear uniforms, and whether time zones will always be necessary.</p><p>The book is impressive not only for the breadth of its scholarship but also for the subtlety and force of its argument. It will be welcomed by sociologists, economists, historians of science and technology, and all curious in general.</p></p><p>&#39;This book is designed to be the synthetic work on the &#39;Information Society&#39; and its origins, and by all rights it will be. It is beautifully done and is built to last...Everything about the book is intelligent.&#39; -Critical ReviewJames Beniger was Associate Professor at the University of Southern California Annenberg School of Communications.</p><h2>Macroeconomics: Understanding the Global Economy (New Edition (2nd &amp; Subsequent) / Third Edition)</h2><p><b><i>Macroeconomics: Understanding the Global Economy, 3rd Edition</i></b> &nbsp; is to help students &#x2013; and indeed anyone &#x2013; understand contemporary and past economic events that shape the world we live in, and at a sophisticated level.&nbsp; But it does so without focusing on mathematical techniques and models for their own sake. <p>Theory is taken seriously &#x2013; so much so that the authors go to pains to understand the key aspects of theories in a way that will not put people off before they see how theories are useful to analyse issues.&nbsp; The authors believe that theories are essential to better understand the world, thus the book includes a wealth of historic and current episodes and data to both see how theories can help interpret the world and also to judge their validity.</p> <p>Economies today are very inter-connected; what happens in China matters pretty much everywhere; and what happens in one (even small) country in the euro zone has implications for the whole euro area and beyond, consequently <b><i>Macroeconomics, 3rd Edition</i></b> adopts a very international focus.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>David Miles</b> is a member of the Bank of England&#x2019;s interest-rate setting Monetary Policy Committee.

Steven Epstein's astute and readable investigation focuses on the critical question of "how certainty is constructed or deconstructed," leading us through the views of medical researchers, activists, policy makers, and others to discover how knowledge about AIDS emerges out of what he calls "credibility struggles."<br><br>Epstein shows the extent to which AIDS research has been a social and political phenomenon and how the AIDS movement has transformed biomedical research practices through its capacity to garner credibility by novel strategies. Epstein finds that nonscientist AIDS activists have gained enough of a voice in the scientific world to shape NIH&#x2013;sponsored research to a remarkable extent. Because of the blurring of roles and responsibilities, the production of biomedical knowledge about AIDS does not, he says, follow the pathways common to science; indeed, AIDS research can only be understood as a field that is unusually broad, public, and contested. He concludes by analyzing recent moves to democratize biomedicine, arguing that although AIDS activists have set the stage for new challenges to scientific authority, all social movements that seek to democratize expertise face unusual difficulties.<br><br>Avoiding polemics and accusations, Epstein provides a benchmark account of the AIDS epidemic to date, one that will be as useful to activists, policy makers, and general readers as to sociologists, physicians, and scientists.</p><p>"The best empirical piece of work on the AIDS epidemic that I have read--detailed, well-informed, and expressed in lucid and accessible prose."--Charles E. Rosenberg, University of Pennsylvania<p>"This study surpasses all the best current writing in the AIDS field and bids fair, in my opinion, to set the standard for some time to come--not only in relation to the policy problems and the scientific and political conflicts associated with AIDS but also in the academic arenas of sociology of science, sociology of knowledge, and sociological theory."--Virginia Olesen, University of California, San Francisco</p><b>Steven Epstein</b> is Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of California, San Diego.

The book will appeal to graduate students, researchers, and most of all, practicing financial engineers [...] So often, financial engineering texts are very theoretical. This book is not." --Glyn Holton, Contingency Analysis</p></p><p><p>Monte Carlo simulation has become an essential tool in the pricing of derivative securities and in risk management. These applications have, in turn, stimulated research into new Monte Carlo methods and renewed interest in some older techniques.</p> <p>This book develops the use of Monte Carlo methods in finance and it also uses simulation as a vehicle for presenting models and ideas from financial engineering. It divides roughly into three parts. The first part develops the fundamentals of Monte Carlo methods, the foundations of derivatives pricing, and the implementation of several of the most important models used in financial engineering. The next part describes techniques for improving simulation accuracy and efficiency. The final third of the book addresses special topics: estimating price sensitivities, valuing American options, and measuring market risk and credit risk in financial portfolios.</p> <p>The most important prerequisite is familiarity with the mathematical tools used to specify and analyze continuous-time models in finance, in particular the key ideas of stochastic calculus. Prior exposure to the basic principles of option pricing is useful but not essential.</p> <p>The book is aimed at graduate students in financial engineering, researchers in Monte Carlo simulation, and practitioners implementing models in industry.</p><p>"<strong>Paul Glasserman has written an astonishingly good book that bridges financial engineering and the Monte Carlo method.

However, reading Bourdieu can be difficult for those not familiar with the French cultural context, and until now a comprehensive introduction to Bourdieu's oeuvre has not been available.<br> <br> David Swartz focuses on a central theme in Bourdieu's work&#x2014;the complex relationship between culture and power&#x2014;and explains that sociology for Bourdieu is a mode of political intervention. Swartz clarifies Bourdieu's difficult concepts, noting where they have been misinterpreted by critics and where they have fallen short in resolving important analytical issues. The book also shows how Bourdieu has synthesized his theory of practices and symbolic power from Durkheim, Marx, and Weber, and how his work was influenced by Sartre, Levi-Strauss, and Althusser.<br> <br> <i>Culture and Power</i> is the first book to offer both a sympathetic and critical examination of Bourdieu's work and it will be invaluable to social scientists as well as to a broader audience in the humanities.</p></p><p></p><h2>ACSM&#39;s Exercise Testing and Prescription (American College of Sports Medicine)</h2><p><b>ACSM&#x2019;S</b> Exercise Testing and Prescription adapts and expands upon the assessment and exercise prescription-related content from <i>ACSM&#x2019;s Resource Manual for Guidelines for Exercise Testing and Prescription, 7th Edition,</i> to create a true classroom resource.

Rejecting doctrines of innate principles and ideas, Locke shows how all our ideas, even the most abstract and complex, are grounded in human experience--attained by sensation of external things or reflection upon our mental activities. A thorough examination of the communication of ideas through language and the convention of taking words as signs of ideas paves the way for his penetrating critique of the limitations of ideas and the extent of our knowledge of ourselves, the world, God and morals. This abridgement, based on P.H. Nidditch's acclaimed critical edition, retains in full all key passages, thus enabling Locke's arguments to be more clearly followed. The new introduction by Pauline Phemister provides valuable background on Locke's essay, illuminating its arguments and conclusions.

The focus of this book, written for mathematicians, needleworkers, and teachers of mathematics, is on the relationship between mathematics and the fiber arts (including knitting, crocheting, cross-stitch, and quilting). Each chapter starts with an overview of the mathematics and the needlework at a level understandable to both mathematicians and needleworkers, followed by more technical sections discussing the mathematics, how to introduce the mathematics in the classroom through needlework, and how to make the needlework project, including patterns and instructions.</p><p>We invite you to peruse the first book to contain both mathematics papers and fiber arts project instructions. Our fervent desire is that if you are mainly interested in the patterns, you will also try reading the Overview sections to see how the math feels. If you are mainly interested in the math, we hope that you will also try out the teaching ideas to hook your students further into mathematics. And, if your goal is to make your classroom a little more snazzy, we hope you will also try to make some of the projects yourself. The interplay between the sections of each chapter is amazing, and you will be surprised how much more fulfilling each part is when combined with the others.sarah-marie belcastro is a Research Associate at Smith College, Northampton, MA.

Davis argues forcefully against &#x201c;ableist&#x201d; discourse and for a complete recasting of the category of disability itself.<br><br><i>Enforcing Normalcy</i>&nbsp;surveys the emergence of a cluster of concepts around the term &#x201c;normal&#x201d; as these matured in western Europe and the United States over the past 250 years. Linking such notions to the concurrent emergence of discourses about the nation, Davis shows how the modern nation-state constructed its identity on the backs not only of colonized subjects, but of its physically disabled minority. In a fascinating chapter on contemporary cultural theory, Davis explores the pitfalls of privileging the figure of sight in conceptualizing the nature of textuality. And in a treatment of nudes and fragmented bodies in Western art, he shows how the ideal of physical wholeness is both demanded and denied in the classical aesthetics of representation.<br><br><i>Enforcing Normalcy</i>&nbsp;redraws the boundaries of political and cultural discourse.

Because Jesus was undeniably male and because the Christian church claims him as the unique God-bearer, feminist christology confronts the dual tasks of explaining the significance of a male God-bearer for women and creating a christological model adequate to feminist experience. Jacquelyn Grant rehearses the development and challenges of feminist christology and argues that, because it has reflected the experience of White women predominantly, it fails to speak to the concerns of non-white and non-western women. In response to this failure, Grant proposes a womanist theology and christology that emerge from and are adequate to the reality of contemporary Black women.<br></p><p></p><h2>Hegel&#39;s Philosophy of Nature: Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences (1830), Part II (Hegel&#39;s Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences)</h2><p>This is a much-needed reissue of the standard English translation of Hegel&#39;s Philosophy of Nature, originally published in 1970.

Brookes Publishing Co. All rights reserved.

Their entry into these schools poses some new curricular challenges. We know that many of the curricular offerings in today's schools (e.g., language arts, math, science, social studies, physical education, fine arts) can accommodate these new students when adaptations are planned and instructional supports are made available. But further examination reveals that the existing scope of most schools' curricula is not broad enough to encompass all the activities or areas of competence that may be appropriate for a given student. This is particularly evident in the community living areas. While it is true that most students in our public schools will not need explicit instruction in skills that fall within the community living areas, such as learning how to use a pay phone, getting dressed to go swimming, or shopping in a grocery store, it is important to acknowledge that there are some students who will. If schools are committed to the mission of educating all students, then attention must be given to expanding the scope of public school curricula to include these community living areas.</p><p><b>Philosophy</b></p><p>This community-referenced curriculum guide is based on the premise that every student, no matter how severe his or her disabilities, is capable of living, working, and recreating in the community. Therefore, this guide has been designed with the following principles in mind:</p><ul><li>When necessary, schooling should include direct preparation for the activities of daily life. Some members of a student body may need direct instruction in areas pertaining to community living in order to become active participants in everyday life.</li><br><br><li>Social integration is an essential element of an appropriate education. Becoming a part of school life is viewed as an essential step toward becoming a part of community life.</li><br><br><li>Home-school collaboration is vital to the success of an educational program. Sincere efforts to establish strong partnerships with parents must take place.</li><br><br><li>Instructional decision making must be individualized. Decisions should reflect unique learner characteristics, chronological age, student and parent input, and so forth.</li><br><br><li>Interdependence and partial participation are valid educational goals. Students should not be excluded from an activity because they will not be able to do it independently.</li><br><br><li>Structured learning can occur in a variety of settings. Meaningful instruction is not limited to school settings; it can also take place in the surrounding community where students can learn and practice skills in real-life settings.</li></ul><p><b>Intended Population</b></p><p><b>The Syracuse Community-Referenced Curriculum Guide</b> is intended for teachers and parents of students with moderate and severe disabilities (ages 5&#x2013;21). It is not intended, however, to be used as a prescription for the exact curriculum that would be offered a particular group or population of students. Rather, this guide provides a framework for decision making that should be applied to individuals on a student-by-student basis. We would expect individualized decisions to vary considerably depending on a range of factors, including the student's age, present ability to participate in community living activities, personal and parental preferences, and so forth.</p><p>The term "teachers" is used broadly throughout this guide. It is meant to include classroom teachers, therapists, teaching assistants, vocational teachers, and others who assume instructional responsibilities within a given school district. The term "moderate and severe disabilities" is also inclusive of many individuals. It includes student who traditionally have been labeled moderately, severely, or profoundly retarded, as well as individuals who may be labeled multiply handicapped, autistic, sensory-impaired, and/or deaf/blind.</p><p><b>Content and Coverage</b></p><p>The core of <b>The Syracuse Community-Referenced Curriculum Guide</b> is devoted to the content areas that directly prepare a student to function in the real world: self-management/home living; vocational; recreation/leisure; and general community functioning. We have also included a section on functional academic skills. Finally, there is a section devoted to skill areas that we believe are best thought of as "embedded" within daily activities: social, communicative, and motor. In addition to these sections that outline the content areas, the Guide contains sections on home-school collaboration, and other implementation strategies, including: developing individualized education programs (IEPs), scheduling, managing classroom operations, and planning and implementing activity-based lesson plans.</p><p>Each section offers practical strategies for decision making. The community living, functional academics, and embedded skills sections begin with a framework that organizes the content. There are scope and sequence charts for each community living area &#x2014; self-management/home living, vocational, recreation/leisure, and general community functioning &#x2014; and for functional academics. And, there are skill functions charts for embedded social, communication, and motor skills. Each of these charts is followed by a step-by-step decision process that will lead to the identification of individualized goals and objectives for a particular student. Examples and illustrations are used in various places; one case study example is carried throughout to afford the user a more complete picture of the Guide's impact on one student to whom we refer as "Mary Z." A series of frequently posed questions appear in most chapters with answers based on the experiences of those who have implemented a community-referenced curriculum. Finally, at the end of each chapter we offer a list of suggested readings and resources that should assist the user to locate materials and to become more knowledgeable in a particular area of interest.</p><p><b>Scope and Sequence Charts </b></p><p>The scope of a curriculum consists of the range of content areas for which knowledge and skills are delineated. As previously mentioned, the scope of the Guide consists of four major community living areas: self-management/home living, vocational, recreation/leisure, and general community functioning. It also includes functional academics and embedded social communication, and motor skills. The sequence of a curriculum refers to the order in which learning activities occur, across ages or grade levels. The sequence of this guide covers an age span of 5 to 21, with the community living content organized into the following grade and age levels: kindergarten (age 5); primary elementary (ages 6&#x2013;8); intermediate elementary (ages 9&#x2013;11); middle school (ages 12&#x2013;14); high school (ages 15&#x2013;18; and transition (ages 19&#x2013;21). Chart 1.1 depicts the areas covered by the scope and sequence charts in the community living section of the Guide.</p><p>Many community-referenced curriculum guides contain unwieldy lists of activities. (Some guides contain literally hundreds of activities that are listed with few guidelines as to their relative importance.) While these listings are helpful to teachers and parents, their usefulness is diminished unless they are accompanied by guidelines for decision making. Without such guidelines team members are left with many questions, such as:</p><ul><li>How can we possibly address all of the community living activities within the practical constraints of a typical school program?</li><br><br><li>If we can't address all community living activities contained in the listings, which are the most essential to learn?</li><br><br><li>At which age should a particular activity be introduced? (For example, should a student as young as 10 or 11 years old leave school for vocational training?)</li><br><br><li>When are logical times of the day to provide instruction? Aren't some activities better suited to after school hours or on weekends?</li></ul><p>The scope and sequence charts that are included in each community living chapter have addressed these questions in the following ways. First, we recognized that it is unrealistic to expect that all community living activities can be sufficiently addressed during a student's educational career. Therefore, the scope and sequence charts in the Guide are organized into an inventory of priority areas; they are intended to serve merely as a framework from which the team will select the individual goals that seem most important for a particular student at a given point in time.</p><p>Second, we acknowledged that learning does not stop at age 21. Too often, our curricular decisions are driven by a "now or never" attitude. That is, if a student does not master an important community living skill during his or her school year, he or she will never have the opportunity to learn it in adulthood. This belief has led to having young students learn activities such as how to prepare family meals, do laundry, work in several different jobs, and so on &#x2014; sometimes long before most nondisabled peers would be expected to engage in these activities. To remedy this, we have designed the scope and sequence charts with typical age expectations in mind. Activities are sequenced to the ages at which most children might be expected to participate in them.</p><p>Third, attention has been given as to when instructional opportunities more "naturally" occur. We recognize the overlap between many community living activities and the activities that already exist in the schedules of many regular education students. Activities such as learning how to use the school cafeteria, manage belongings at one's locker, play games at recess, and perform school or community (work-study) jobs are just a few of the activities represented on the scope and sequence charts that are applicable to students with and without disabilities. Furthermore, many recreation/leisure activities can be addressed within the extracurricular program offered by the school district (e.g., ski club, gymnastics, band, art club).</p><p>Finally, we have seen how other community living activities &#x2014; that do not necessarily overlap with typical school schedules &#x2014; can be reasonably incorporated into students' programs (e.g., shopping for food items that will be used at snack time or in home economics; making a trip to the public library and later stopping at a restaurant). We have also addressed community living activities that more naturally occur at times and in settings that extend beyond the school program. Such activities might include preparing breakfast, keeping the bedroom neat, and raking the lawn. With this in mind, we have devised two separate kinds of charts. One kind appears within the body of the Guide, and contains activities for which instructional opportunities are already present or can be reasonably incorporated during the regular school day (including extracurricular activities). The other kind appears in Appendix B, and includes activities for which instructional opportunities typically occur apart from school-before school, in the evenings, or on the weekends &#x2014; and that are considered better suited to instruction during these nonschool hours. (However, these activities may be incorporated into an individualized education program [IEP] under certain circumstances, particularly when a parent makes a specific request. These circumstances are further discussed within each of the community living chapters of the Guide.)</p><p>Each of these considerations has helped us sift through the extensive listings of community living activities and arrive at a more manageable framework for educational decision making.</p><p>Excerpted from <b>The Syracuse Community-Referenced Curriculum Guide for Students with Moderate and Severe Disabilities,</b> edited by Alison Ford, Ph.D., Roberta Schnorr, M.S., Luanna Meyer, Ph.D., Linda Davern, M.S., Jim Black, M.S., &amp; Patrick Dempsey, M.S.</p><p>Copyright � 1989 by Paul H.

Playful, enthralling, and whip-smart, his writing makes ingenious connections between ideas, thinkers, and things. An extended meditation on the mysteries of color and the fascination they provoke, <i>What Color Is the Sacred?</i> is the next step on Taussig&#x2019;s remarkable intellectual path.<br> <br> Following his interest in magic and surrealism, his earlier work on mimesis, and his recent discussion of heat, gold, and cocaine in <i>My Cocaine Museum</i>,this book uses color to explore further dimensions of what Taussig calls &#x201c;the bodily unconscious&#x201d; in an age of global warming. Drawing on classic ethnography as well as the work of Benjamin, Burroughs, and Proust, he takes up the notion that color invites the viewer into images and into the world. Yet, as Taussig makes clear, color has a history&#x2014;a manifestly colonial history rooted in the West&#x2019;s discomfort with color, especially bright color, and its associations with the so-called primitive. He begins by noting Goethe&#x2019;s belief that Europeans are physically averse to vivid color while the uncivilized revel in it, which prompts Taussig to reconsider colonialism as a tension between chromophobes and chromophiliacs. And he ends with the strange story of coal, which, he argues, displaced colonial color by giving birth to synthetic colors, organic chemistry, and IG Farben, the giant chemical corporation behind the Third Reich.<br> <br> Nietzsche once wrote, &#x201c;So far, all that has given colour to existence still lacks a history.&#x201d; With <i>What Color Is the Sacred?</i> Taussig has taken up that challenge with all the radiant intelligence and inspiration we&#x2019;ve come to expect from him.</p> <p></p> <p></p></p><p><p><b>Michael Taussig</b> is professor of anthropology at Columbia University and the author of several books, including <i>Walter Benjamin&#x2019;s Grave</i> and <i>My Cocaine Museum</i>, both published by the University of Chicago Press.</p>&#34;If Hunter S.

Each chapter deals with a fundamental question about human existence, exploring the subject through representative readings by classic, modern, and contemporary philosophers--with at least two contrasting perspectives for each main position. <b> </b> What Is Philosophy? Am I a Body and a Mind? Am I Free or Determined? What Grounds Do I Have For Belief in God? On What Principle Do I Judge Things Right or Wrong? When Should I Obey the Law? What Things Shall I Call Art? When Can I Say "I Know?" What Is Science? Positivism to Post-Modernism. Applied Ethics (medical ethics, business ethics, environmental ethics). Making Sense Out Of Life (a multi-cultural perspective). <b> </b> For anyone interested in modern philosophy. </p></p><p>This well-known introductory anthology was the first to intersperse primary sources with commentary to keep students interested and critically engaged in what they are reading. The overall structure of the text further adds to its student appeal. Each chapter deals with a fundamental question about human existence, exploring the subject through representative readings by classic, modern, and contemporary philosophers. At least two contrasting perspectives elucidate each main position. In this latest edition, that debate has been expanded with many new voices and ideas.<p><b>A Note on the Seventh Edition</b></p> <p> Throughout the various editions of this text, the aim has been to introduce students to the wonder and rigor of philosophical analysis. We have tried to achieve a balance between making things plain for beginners and displaying conventional philosophical rigor for the more advanced student. This is the justification for our editorial comments breaking up the original sources in many of the readings. Sometimes the material is just too difficult or too long for beginning students, who often need to be reassured that they have actually understood a passage before they continue their reading. </p> <p> While our strategy of shaping each chapter to reflect answers to the enduring questions of philosophy remains unchanged in this edition, nevertheless every chapter has undergone revisions ranging from enhanced editorial comments to new primary sources. Chapter 2 on the mind-body problem includes new material from Searle as well as a critique of him by Paul and Patricia Churchland. Chapter 3 has been enriched by a reading from John Hospers exploring the implications of psychology for the free will/determinism debate. Chapter 4 dealing with grounds for belief in God now includes St. Anselm's ontological argument for the existence of God. In discussing social and political philosophy in Chapter 6, we have added readings from John Locke, Robert Paul Wolff, and John Rawls. We enhanced our discussion of art in Chapter 7 by including material from Clive Bell, Paul Ziff, and Susan Sontag, and our examination of science in Chapter 9 by adding a discussion of the feminist philosophy of science by Helen Longino. We have also added another epilogue. The first epilogue deals with applied ethics in the fields of medicine, business, and the environment. The second epilogue continues to explore human cosmic stories from the biblical, Buddhist, African, Marxian, and existentialist traditions that invest life with meaning but concludes with an essay by Peter Geach on postdeath survival that introduces the issue of whether death is going to sleep or going on a journey, whether one's story ends at death or continues. </p> <p> Adding new material led to the painful decision to delete some of the material included in the sixth edition. We believe that our editorial decisions have made for a better text of which Alburey Castell, who edited the first edition in 1943 and continued to be senior editor until his death in 1987, would be proud. </p> <p> We would like to thank the Prentice-Hall staff, especially our production editor, Kim Gueterman, for the first-class professional assistance they have given us. Also, we are grateful to the secretaries in the Philosophy Department, Penny Schall and Patricia Black, who have aided us in so many ways. </p> <p> Finally, our wives, Mary Ellen and Laurie, deserve our gratitude for their encouragement and support during the many hours we spent in bringing this project to completion. </p> <p> <i>Donald M.

These plays provide a unique glimpse of women not only in their familiar domestic roles but also in relation to household and city, religion and government, war and peace, theater and festival, and, of course, to men.</p> <p></p> <p>This freshly revised edition presents, for the first time in a single volume, all three plays in faithful modern translations that preserve intact Aristophanes&#x2019; blunt and often obscene language, sparkling satire, political provocation, and beguiling fantasy. Alongside the translations are ample introductions and notes covering the politically engaged genre of Aristophanic comedy in general and issues of sex and gender in particular, which have been fully updated since the first edition in light of recent scholarship. An appendix contains fragments of lost plays of Aristophanes that also featured women, and an up-to-date bibliography provides guidance for further exploration.</p> <p></p> <p>In addition to their timeless humor and biting satire, the plays are unique and invaluable documents in the history of western sexuality and gender, and they offer strikingly prescient speculations about the social and political future of the female sex.</p></p><p><strong>Jeffrey Henderson</strong> is Professor of Classical Studies at Boston University.

Many frustrated college students of art know this all too well as they suffer through unstructured classes with inexperienced teachers or graduate student instructors. In these situations, it is easy to blame the teachers. But the problem is largely institutional: most students graduating with MFAs from art schools receive little if any instruction in teaching art. If you find yourself in this predicament as teacher or student, this book is for you.<br><br>The first book to provide a comprehensive guide for teaching college-level art, <em>The Art of Teaching Art</em> is the culmination of respected artist and instructor Deborah Rockman's two decades of teaching experience. Believing that drawing is the backbone of all of the visual arts, she begins with a complete explanation of drawing concepts that apply to any subject matter, e.g., composition, sighting processes, scaling techniques, and methods for linear and tonal development. She then illustrates these concepts with step-by-step methods that easily translate to classroom exercises. Next, she applies the drawing principles to every artist's most important and challenging subject, the human figure. After an extended section on understanding and teaching perspective that explores illusionistic form and space, the focus of the book shifts to the studio classroom itself and the essential elements that go into making an effective learning environment and curriculum. From preparing materials lists and syllabi, to setting up still-lifes, handling difficult classroom situations, critiquing and grading student artworks, and shooting slides of student artworks, she leaves no stone unturned.<br></p><p><br><strong>Deborah A. Rockman</strong> is Professor of Art in the Foundation and Fine Arts Department, Kendall College of Art and Design.<br><br>"In thirty- six years of teaching all aspects of drawing to students aspiring to become artists and teachers, I have labored my way by trial and error to conclusions Deborah Rockman outlines so very clearly in her <em>THE ART OF TEACHING ART</em>. With high tuition costs, students have the right to demand sensitive and informed instruction even from teachers just beginning their career. This comprehensive compendium of the arcana of studio teaching is invaluable. The special difficulties of revealing the possibilites and limits of perspective are well presented; insights I thought all my own I find in this book."-R. Richard Gayton, Drawing and Painting Professor, California College of Arts and Crafts<p></p><br>"A much-needed guide to the teaching and learning of important areas of foundation drawing. The book's explication of sighting, scaling, and perspective methods is particularly useful. Also, the emphasis on teaching methods of visual measure and the need for a translation process between 2-D and 3-D seeing is welcome. The focus on these issues will encourage many teachers to go into much greater depth than is the usual practice. Rockman provides enough information and detail to aid teachers in creating classroom assignments and for students to practice these techniques without a teacher. I have always believed that, particularly in art and design, teaching and learning are intimately interrelated activities and that one important way of leaning a subject matter is to teach it. <em>The Art of Teaching Art</em> encourages teachers to be students and students to imagine being teachers." --Bill Fasolino, Foundation Chairperson, Pratt Institute School of Art &amp; Design<p></p><br>"Rockman demystifies the process of perceptual drawing by comprehensively providing practical methods and strategies for measuring visual experience. The book includes lucid explanation of proportion, perspective, composition and metaphor to space. An excellent, clearly illustrated introduction to the teaching of the visual arts, <em>The Art of Teaching Art</em> is a pleasure for artists, students and teachers who are interested in the project of approaching representation of nature. In fact, the well-organized treatment and wealth of information, illustration and defining vocabulary may well become a handbook for professionals working in this arena of the visual arts." --Thomas Cornell, Professor of Art, Bowdoin College<p></p><br></p><h2>Introduction to Mathematical Statistics</h2><p><p> <b>Introduction to Mathematical Statistics, Seventh Edition,</b> offers a proven approach designed to provide you with an excellent foundation in mathematical statistics.

Calhoun represented the foremost statemen of their age. In the decades preceding the Civil War, they dominated American congressional politics as no other figures have. Now Merrill D. Peterson, one of our most gifted historians, brilliantly re-creates the lives and times of these great men in this monumental collective biography.<br> Arriving on the national scene at the onset of the War of 1812 and departing political life during the ordeal of the Union in 1850-52, Webster, Clay, and Calhoun opened--and closed--a new era in American politics. In outlook and style, they represented startling contrasts: Webster, the Federalist and staunch New England defender of the Union; Clay, the "war hawk" and National Rebublican leader from the West; Calhoun, the youthful nationalist who became the foremost spokesman of the South and slavery. They came together in the Senate for the first time in 1832, united in their opposition of Andrew Jackson, and thus gave birth to the idea of the "Great Triumvirate." Entering the history books, this idea survived the test of time because these men divided so much of American politics between them for so long.<br> Peterson brings to life the great events in which the Triumvirate figured so prominently, including the debates on Clay's American System, the Missouri Compromise, the Webster-Hayne debate, the Bank War, the Webster-Ashburton Treaty, the annexation of Texas, and the Compromise of 1850. At once a sweeping narrative and a penetrating study of non-presidential leadership, this book offers an indelible picture of this conservative era in which statesmen viewed the preservation of the legacy of free government inherited from the Founding Fathers as their principal mission. In fascinating detail, Peterson demonstrates how precisely Webster, Clay, and Calhoun exemplify three facets of this national mind.<br></p><p>Peterson brings to life the great events in which the Triumvirate figures so Prominently.<br><strong>Merrill D.

Also included are the principal testimonia, the ancients' reports on the lives and work of the two poets.</p><p>The five volumes in the Loeb Classical Library edition of Greek Lyric contain the surviving fragments of solo and choral song. This poetry was not preserved in medieval manuscripts, and few complete poems remain. Later writers quoted from the poets, but only so much as suited their needs; these quotations are supplemented by papyrus texts found in Egypt, most of them badly damaged. The high quality of what remains makes us realise the enormity of our loss.</p><p>Volume I presents Sappho and Alcaeus. Volume II contains the work of Anacreon, composer of solo song; the <i> Anacreontea</i>; and the earliest writers of choral poetry, notably the seventh-century Spartans Alcman and Terpander. Stesichorus, Ibycus, Simonides, and other sixth-century poets are in Volume III. Bacchylides and other fifth-century poets are in Volume IV along with Corinna (although some argue that she belongs to the third century). Volume V contains the new school of poets active from the mid-fifth to the mid-fourth century and also collects folk songs, drinking songs, hymns, and other anonymous pieces.</p></p><p><p>David A.

It provides the standard material in a coherent presentation and uses a notation that is more consistent with the research literature in process control. Topics that are unique include a unified approach to model representations, process model formation and process identification, multivariable control, statistical quality control, and model-based control. This book is designed to be used as an introductory text for undergraduate courses in process dynamics and control. In addition to chemical engineering courses, the text would also be suitable for such courses taught in mechanical, nuclear, industrial, and metallurgical engineering departments. <br> The material is organized so that modern concepts are presented to the student but details of the most advanced material are left to later chapters. The text material has been developed, refined, and classroom tested over the last 10-15 years at the University of Wisconsin and more recently at the University of Delaware. As part of the course at Wisconsin, a laboratory has been developed to allow the students hands-on experience with measurement instruments, real time computers, and experimental process dynamics and control problems.<br></p><p><br>Babatunde Ogunnaike is Senior Research Associate at E.I. duPont de Nemours and Company and Adjunct Professor in the Chemical Engineering Department at the University of Delaware. <br> W.

In short, the post-Cold War security order that the US had constructed after 1991 seemed to be coming apart at the seams. <br><br>David Kilcullen was one of the architects of America's strategy in the late phases of the second Gulf War, and he has also spent time in Afghanistan and other hotspots. In <em>Blood Year</em>, he provides a wide-angle view of the current situation in the Middle East and analyzes how America and the West ended up in such dire circumstances. Kilcullen lays much of the blame on Bush's initial decision to invade Iraq (which had negative secondary effects in Afghanistan), but also takes Obama to task for simply withdrawing and adopting a "leading from behind" strategy. As events have proven, Kilcullen contends, withdrawal was a fundamentally misguided plan. The U.S. had uncorked the genie, and it had a responsibility to at least attempt to keep it under control. Instead, the U.S. is at a point where administration officials state that the losses of Ramadi and Palmyra are manageable setbacks. Kilcullen argues that the U.S. needs to re-engage in the region, whether it wants to or not, because it is largely responsible for the situation that is now unfolding. Blood Year is an essential read for anyone interested in understanding not only why the region that the U.S. invaded a dozen years ago has collapsed into utter chaos, but also what the U.S. can do to alleviate the grim situation.<br></p><p><br><strong>Dr. David Kilcullen</strong> is the Chairman of Caerus Associates.

The former stresses the importance of managerial leadership and cooperation among employees, while the latter focuses on the engineering of incentive systems that will induce efficiency, and profitability, by rewarding worker self-interest. In this innovative book, Gary Miller bridges the gap between these literatures. He demonstrates that it is impossible to design an incentive system based on self-interest that will effectively discipline all subordinates and superiors and obviate or overcome the roles of political conflict, collective action, and leadership in an organization. Applying game theory to the analysis of the roles of cooperation and political leadership in organizational hierarchies, he concludes that the organization whose managers can inspire cooperation and the transcendence of short-term interest in its employees enjoys a competitive advantage.</p><p>Applying game theory to the analysis of the roles of cooperation and political leadership in organizational hierarchies, this study concludes that the organization whose managers can inspire cooperation and the transcendence of short-term interest in its employees enjoys a competitive advantage.&#34;In sum, this is a useful book....Miller&#39;s informal, intuitive presentation of highly technical results is excellent and may convince organizational sociologists that rational choice theory has more to tell about organizations than just that hierarchical structures economize in transaction costs.&#34; Thomas Voss, Contemporary Sociology</p><h2>Crime in the Making: Pathways and Turning Points through Life</h2><p>This new explanation of crime over the life course provides an important foundation for rethinking contemporary theory and criminal justice policy.

Several years ago, Robert Sampson and John Laub dusted off sixty cartons of the Gleucks&#x2019; data that had been stored in the basement of the Harvard Law School. After a lengthy process of recoding and reanalyzing these data, they developed and tested a theory of informal social control that acknowledges the importance of childhood behavior but rejects the implication that adult social factors have little relevance.</p><p><p>Robert J.

Written to refute those religions and show how they fail, unlike most books on world religions, this title dives into the secular nature of these false doctrines and shows: </p><ul> <li>The need to be able to spot their tenets and oppose them instead of allowing them to subtly infiltrate our Christianity and undermine us.</li> <li>How you can powerfully refute these humanistic religions and cults.</li> <li>How to effectively present the gospel to people who have been deceived.</li> </ul> <p> This book starts with God&#x2019;s Word as the absolute authority. In doing so, God becomes our guide to refute false religions, and highlights the true power of His Word. Ultimately, there are only two religions in the world: God&#x2019;s true religion and the religions of man. All of man&#x2019;s religions are simply variations of humanism in its broadest sense.</p></p><p>BODIE HODGE attended Southern Illinois University at Carbondale and received a B.S. and M.S. in mechanical engineering.

Marsden's detailed history relies heavily on primary sources, and his careful attention to the surrounding worlds of mainline denominations and stricter fundamentalism makes this book a major contribution to the study of a movement that has played an important role in shaping American culture.</p><p>The story of the first twenty years of Fuller Seminary, recounted in Reforming Fundamentalism, tells of how these high aspirations clashed with the realities of American cultural and intellectual life and especially with the realities of American evangelicalism. Moreover, these conflicts were refracted through the institution&#39;s intriguing personalities--often with dramatic and in a sense tragic outcomes.George M. Marsden, Francis A.

He died in 1977. Albert Uderzo was born in 1927 in a small village in Marne, France. He met Rene Goscinny in 1951 and on 29 October 1959 their most famous creation, Asterix, made his first appearance on page 20 of Pilote. ASTERIX THE GAUL, their first album, was published in 1961 and there have now been 35 Asterix albums.Reviewed with Albert Uderzo's <i>Asterix and Son</i> and <i>Asterix and the Great Divide</i>.<p>Gr. 4-8. The comic-book alternate history adventures of Asterix and his buddy Obelix, begun in France in 1961, has continued through 31 volumes. These books (from 1983, 1981, and 1980, respectively) are new to American publication, though they have been available in Britain. Each story is filled with broad physical humor and puns that work in English as well as in the original French, and virtually no indigenous or ethnic group escapes Uderzo's wit (at one point, the heroes are invited to bed down in a Bethlehem cowshed.). In <i>Asterix and Son,</i> Asterix and Obelix become guardians of a kidnapped baby who takes a potion and develops superhuman strength. In <i>Black Gold</i>, the heroes travel to Mesopotamia in search of more potion. In the <i>Great Divide,</i> competition between two village chieftains gives the Romans an opportunity to conquer. The cartoons are playfully round and brightly colored, and the architectural and martial details go beyond simple stereotypes. Asterix already has lots of fans; here are three new-to-America episodes that will please devotees as well as gather uninitiated readers with their mix of humor, history, and good storytelling. <i>Francisca Goldsmith</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Jessie asked from the back seat, tapping the window glass three times. Jessie always tapped the window three times when they passed under a bridge.</p><b> </b>"Another hour," said Mrs. Treski. She glanced at the clock on the dashboard. "At least."<p></p><b> </b>They had already been driving for three hours, climbing steadily higher and higher into the mountains, and Jessie could feel herself sinking into a sulk. Everything about this trip to Grandma&#x2019;s house was different.<p></p><b> </b>First of all, Evan was sitting in the front seat.<p></p><b> </b>Jessie could tell he was listening to his iPod. From behind, she could see his head bobbing slightly to the beat of the music as he stared out the window.<p></p><b> </b>Evan had never been allowed to sit up front before. But this time, when he&#x2019;d asked&#x2015;for the ten thousandth time&#x2015;Mrs. Treski had given him a long, thoughtful look and said yes. He was ten and tall for his age, so Mrs. Treski said he was old enough to move up front.<p></p><b> </b>Jessie was nine&#x2015;and stuck in the back.<p></p><b> </b>"Hey," Jessie said, trying to get Evan to turn around and notice her. But he didn&#x2019;t. He couldn&#x2019;t hear her. It was like he wasn&#x2019;t even in the car with her.<p></p><b> </b>Jessie stared out the window at the farmland as it whizzed by them. Usually, she loved this drive. She loved to count things along the way&#x2015;cows, hawks, Mini Coopers, out-of-state license plates. She kept tally marks in her notebook, and at the end of the trip, she would count them all up to see who had won. It was almost always the cows.<p></p><b> </b>She also tracked their progress by looking for important landmarks along the way&#x2015;like the pest control building that had a forty-foot fiberglass cockroach creeping over the roof, or the two-story carved wooden totem pole that was really a cell phone tower, or the billboard for a diner that had a big metal teapot with real steam coming out of it.<p></p><b> </b>Evan used to be on the lookout for these landmarks, too, and it was a race to see who could spot each one first. But this year, he didn&#x2019;t seem to care. Even when the giant water storage tank painted like a ladybug came into view and Jessie pointed it out to him, he just shrugged, as if he couldn&#x2019;t be bothered. He was no fun, and suddenly the trip felt long.<p></p><b> </b>They passed under another bridge, and Jessie tapped the window three times. "Why did Grandma set her house on fire?" she asked.<p></p><b> </b>Mrs. Treski&#x2019;s eyes shifted from the road to the rearview mirror, locking on Jessie&#x2019;s reflection for a second before returning to the highway. "She didn&#x2019;t mean to. It was an accident."<p></p><b> </b>"I know," said Jessie. "But why did it happen <i>this</i> time?"<p></p><b> </b>Mrs. Treski tipped her head to one side. "Acci-dents happen. Sometimes there&#x2019;s no reason. She left something on the stove, and it caught on fire. It could happen to anyone."<p></p><b> </b>But it hadn&#x2019;t happened to her grandma before. Jessie thought about all the times Grandma had cooked noodles for her or made hot chocolate for her or heated up soup for her. Not once had she set the house on fire.<p></p><b> </b>It was because of the fire that they were driving up to Grandma&#x2019;s two days <i>after</i> Christmas instead of the day <i>before</i>, the way they always did. And it was because of the fire that they weren&#x2019;t even sure if they would be staying at Grandma&#x2019;s for New Year&#x2019;s Eve the way they did every year. And that was the really big thing that was different this time.<p></p><b> </b>For as long as Jessie could remember, New Year&#x2019;s Eve meant staying at Grandma&#x2019;s house and the long, slow climb to the top of Lovell&#x2019;s Hill, where the trees parted and the sky opened and there stood the old iron bell hanging on its heavy wooden crossbeam.<p></p><b> </b>Just before midnight they would gather, walking through the snow-covered woods, coming from all sides of the hill&#x2015;neighbors and friends, family and sometimes even strangers&#x2015;to sing the old songs and talk about the year gone by.<p></p><b> </b>And then, just before midnight, the youngest one in the crowd and the oldest one, too, would step forward and both take hold of the rope that hung from the clapper of the dark and heavy bell, and at precisely the right moment, they would ring in the New Year, as loudly and joyously and for as long as they wanted.<p></p><b> </b>Jessie remembered the year when <i>she</i> had been the youngest one on the hill, and what it felt like when Mrs. Lewis, who was eighty-four that year, had closed her soft, papery hand over hers. They had swung the rope back and forth, over and over, until the noise of the bell filled the snow-covered valley below and the echoes of each peal bounced off of Black Bear Mountain and came racing back to them, like an old faithful dog that always comes home.<p></p><b> </b>But this year, everything was upside down. They might not even spend New Year&#x2019;s Eve at Grandma&#x2019;s house. It all depended Mrs. Treski said. On what? Jessie wondered. She tapped her right knee twice. Not spend New Year&#x2019;s Eve at Grandma&#x2019;s? Who would ring the bell?<p></p><b> </b>Jessie jiggled her legs up and down. Her left foot was feeling prickly because she&#x2019;d had it tucked up under her for the last half-hour. "How much longer to the Crossroads Store?" she asked.<p></p><b> </b>"Oh, Jessie . . ." said her mother, looking in the rearview mirror again. "Do you need to stop?"<p></p><b> </b>"What do you mean?" asked Jessie. It wasn&#x2019;t a question of whether she <i>needed to</i>&#x2015;although now that she thought of it, a trip to the bathroom sounded like a good idea. "We always stop at the Crossroads Store," she said, with a hint of a whine in her voice.<p></p><b> </b>"It&#x2019;s just that I thought this time we could drive straight through," said Mrs. Treski. "We&#x2019;re making such good time, and you know how the weather is in the mountains. You never know what might blow in."<p></p><b> </b>" Mo-o-om," said Jessie. Everything was messed up on this trip. "Evan, you want to stop at the Crossroads, don&#x2019;t you?"<p></p><b> </b>Evan just kept looking out the window, nodding his head in time to the music on his iPod.<p></p><b> </b>"Evan!" Jessie didn&#x2019;t mean to hit him quite so hard on the shoulder.<p></p><b> </b>"Quit it!" he said, turning around to glare at her.<p></p><b> </b>"I&#x2019;m asking you a question!" she shouted. Evan took out one of the ear buds and let it dangle from his ear like a dead worm on a hook. "Do you want to stop at the Crossroads?" Jessie couldn&#x2019;t help thinking the question sounded dumb. Of course he would want to stop.<p></p><b> </b>But Evan just shrugged and put the ear bud back in his ear. "I don&#x2019;t care."<p></p><b> </b>Jessie threw herself against the seat and folded her arms over her chest.<p></p><b> </b>"Relax, Jessie," said Mrs. Treski. "We&#x2019;ll stop. I could use a break to stretch my legs, anyway. But we can&#x2019;t stay too long. I don&#x2019;t want to get to Grandma&#x2019;s after dark." <b><p></p></b> *** <b><p></p></b> The Crossroads Store was a ten-minute detour off the main highway. It was on the corner of two roads that were so dinky, Mrs. Treski called it the intersection of Nowhere and Oblivion. But the store itself was miraculous. It was a combination gas station, deli, bakery, gift shop, bookshop, hunting/fishing/clothing store, and post office. They sold kayaks, guns, taxidermied animals, hunting knives, Get Well cards, umbrellas, joke books, night crawlers, candy, and decorative wall calendars. Jessie could wander the store for hours, wishing she had the money to buy just about everything.<p></p><b> </b>She only had five dollars in her pocket, though. That was all the money she&#x2019;d allowed herself to bring on this trip. Back home in her lock box, she had almost thirty dollars. Most of that was from the money she&#x2019;d made during the lemonade war, or at least what was left over after she made that $104 contribution to the Animal Rescue League. ("You don&#x2019;t have to give as much as I did," Megan had said, but Jessie had insisted. "I said I was going to, and I&#x2019;m going to," she said, even though it almost killed her to give all that money away&#x2015;and to animals!)<p></p><b> </b>But no matter how enticing everything in the Crossroads Store looked to her (a squirrel nutcracker! fake mustaches!), Jessie wasn&#x2019;t about to spend thirty dollars. She liked to have money saved. Just in case.<p></p><b> </b>After using the bathroom, she walked over to where Evan was standing, halfway between the deli and the bakery. He was looking at fancy gift bags of candy, all done up with curlicue ribbons.<p></p><b> </b>"Look!" he said, holding up a bag. It was a bag of chocolate-covered blueberries, named Moose Droppings. "Want some?" he asked, dangling the bag in front of her face.<p></p><b> </b>"That is so gross!" Jessie said. But she loved it. The candy really did look exactly like moose droppings, only smaller. On closer inspection, she saw that there were also chocolate-covered cranberries and chocolate-covered raisins. "Are you going to get a bag? We could split one. Which one do you think is the best?" But Evan had wandered off and wasn&#x2019;t listening to her anymore.<p></p><b> </b>Jessie put the bag back on the shelf and walked over to the corner of the store devoted to jigsaw puzzles. There were a dozen puzzles to choose from, but Jessie&#x2019;s eyes went immediately to the one that was a picture of jellybeans. The brightly colored candies looked like rocks on a pebbly beach, and Jessie knew the puzzle would be hard to do. It had a thousand pieces!<p></p><b> </b>"Jessie, are you ready?" asked her mother, shoving a few dollars back into her wallet after paying for the gas.<p></p><b> </b>"Can we get this? Please?" asked Jessie, pulling the jellybean puzzle down from the shelf. "For Grandma?" Jessie and Grandma always worked on jigsaw puzzles when the family visited, and Jessie often brought a new puzzle for them to try. They had never done a thousand-piece puzzle, though.<p></p><b> </b>Jessie&#x2019;s mom paused, the money still hanging out from her wallet. Jessie knew her mom had to be careful with money, and she tried hard not to ask for things she didn&#x2019;t need. "I have five dollars," said Jessie. "I could chip in."<p></p><b> </b>Mrs. Treski took the puzzle and said, "It&#x2019;s a good idea, Jess. You and Grandma can work on it when she gets home from the hospital."<p></p><b> </b>Jessie smiled, glad she could have the puzzle without spending her own money, and turned to the circular spinning postcard rack that was next to the jigsaw puzzles. There were eight columns of cards, and Jessie liked to make the rack squeak as she turned it slowly. She started at the top and began to work her way straight down one column, and then went back up to the top of the next column. She didn&#x2019;t want to miss a single card.<p></p><b> </b>"Jess, can we go now?" asked her mother, looking through the various compartments of her wallet as if money would magically appear if she looked hard enough.<p></p><b> </b>"No, I&#x2019;m looking at the cards," said Jessie.<p></p><b> </b>"You must own every card on that rack."<p></p><b> </b>"Sometimes they have a new one," said Jessie.<p></p><b> </b>"Five minutes, okay? Five minutes, I want to be pulling out of the parking lot." Mrs. Treski walked off to the checkout counter to pay for the puzzle.<p></p><b> </b>Why was her mom so impatient? Usually she loved to stop at the Crossroads, but this time it was all about making good time and getting back on the road. Well, Jessie wasn&#x2019;t going to be rushed. She finished looking at the second column of postcards, and then started on the third.<p></p><b> </b>"Ever been there?"<p></p><b> </b>Jessie looked up. An old man with a stubbly beard was squinting through his glasses at a postcard that showed the Olympic Stadium in Lake Placid. Jessie noticed that the glasses sat crooked on his face. "The stadium where they had the Olympics? Ever been there?"<p></p><b> </b>Jessie shook her head. "No."<p></p><b> </b>The man tapped the card. "I was there in 1980 <i>and</i> 1932. Yes, I was. I saw Sonja Henie win the gold medal for figure skating. Do you believe that?" He nodded his head up and down as if he could make her do the same.<p></p><b> </b>Wow, 1932! How could anyone be that old? Jessie looked closely at the man standing beside her. He started to scratch his face like he had a bad rash. "Were you in the Olympics?" she asked.<p></p><b> </b>"No!" said the man, "but I had dreams." He was nodding his head more vigorously now&#x2015;nodding and scratching&#x2015;and his eyes were locked on the far end of the store.<p></p><b> </b>"Hey, Jess, come on," said Evan, grabbing hold of one elbow and pulling her toward the door.<p></p><b> </b>"I&#x2019;m not done!" she said. But Evan didn&#x2019;t let go of her until they were outside. When Jessie looked back through the window, she saw that the man was still scratching his face and talking, even though no one was near.<p></p><b> </b>"That guy was crazy," Evan said, matter-of-factly.<p></p><b> </b>"How do you know?" asked Jessie, looking up at her big brother.<p></p><b> </b>Evan shrugged and put his headphones back on. "You can just tell."<p></p><b> </b>But Jessie couldn&#x2019;t tell. It hadn&#x2019;t occurred to her that there was anything wrong with the old man. Why did old people get like that? Did something break down inside their heads, the way a shoelace eventually snaps after being tied too many times? And how exactly did Evan know?<p></p><b> </b>As soon as they got back on the highway, it started to snow.

This discovery prompted a complete reevaluation of previous evidence for human origins.<br><br>In the years since this dramatic discovery Johanson has continued to scour East Africa's Great rift Valley for the earliest evidence of human origins. In 1975 this team unearthed the "First Family", an unparalleled fossil assemblage of 13 individuals dating back to 3.2 million years ago; and in 1986 at the Rift's most famous location, Olduvai Gorge, this same team discovered a 1.8 million-year-old partial adult skeleton that necessitated a reassessment of the earliest members of our own genus <i>Homo.</i><br><br>Johanson's fieldwork continues unabated and recently more fossil members of Lucy's family have been found, including the 1992 discovery of the oldest, most complete skull of her species, with future research now planned for 1996 in the virtually unexplored regions of the most northern extension of the Rift Valley in Eritrea.<br><br><i>From Lucy to Language</i> is a summing up of this remarkable career and a stunning documentary of human life through time on Earth. It is a combination of the vital experience of field work and the intellectual rigor of primary research. It is the fusion of two great writing talents: Johanson and Blake Edgar, an accomplished science writer, editor of the California Academy of Sciences' <i>Pacific Discovery,</i> and co-author of Johanson's last book, <i>Ancestors.</i><br><br><i>From Lucy to Language</i> is one of the greatest stories ever told, bracketing the timeline between bipedalism and human language. Part I addresses the central issues facing anyone seeking to decipher the mystery of human origins. In this section the authors provide answers to the basics -- "What are our closest living relatives?" -- tackle the controversial -- "What is race?" -- and contemplate the imponderables -- "Why did consciousness evolve?"<br><br><i>From Lucy to Language</i> is an encounter with the evidence. Early human fossils are hunted, discovered, identified, excavated, collected, preserved, labeled, cleaned, reconstructed, drawn, fondled, photographed, cast, compared, measured, revered, pondered, published, and argued over endlessly. Fossils like Lucy have become a talisman of sorts, promising to reveal the deepest secrets of our existence. In Part II the authors profile over fifty of the most significant early human fossils ever found. Each specimen is displayed in color and at actual size, most of them in multiple views. With them the authors present the cultural accoutrements associated with the fossils: stone tools which evidence increasing sophistication over time, the earliest stone, clay, and ivory art objects, and the culminating achievement of the dawn of human consciousness -- the magnificent rock and cave paintings of Europe, Africa, Australia, and the Americas.<br><br>In the end <i>From Lucy to Language</i> is a reminder and a challenge. Like no species before us, we now seem poised to control vast parts of the planet and its life. We possess the power to influence, if not govern, evolution. For that reason, we must not forget our link to the natural world and our debt to natural selection. We need to "think deep", to add a dose of geologic time and evolutionary history to our perspective of who we are, where we came from, and where we are headed. This is the most poignant lesson this book has to offer.</p><p>In 1974 in a remote region of Ethiopia, Donald Johanson, then one of America&#39;s most promising young paleoanthropologists, discovered &#34;Lucy&#34;, the oldest, best preserved skeleton of any erect-walking human ever found.

Ortiz&#x2019;s examination of the impact of sugar and tobacco on Cuban society is unquestionably the cornerstone of Cuban studies and a key source for work on Caribbean culture generally. Though written over fifty years ago, Ortiz&#x2019;s study of the formation of a national culture in this region has significant implications for contemporary postcolonial studies.<br>Ortiz presents his understanding of Cuban history in two complementary sections written in contrasting styles: a playful allegorical tale narrated as a counterpoint between tobacco and sugar and a historical analysis of their development as the central agricultural products of the Cuban economy. Treating tobacco and sugar both as agricultural commodities and as social characters in a historical process, he examines changes in their roles as the result of transculturation. His work shows how transculturation, a critical category Ortiz developed to grasp the complex transformation of cultures brought together in the crucible of colonial and imperial histories, can be used to illuminate not only the history of Cuba, but, more generally, that of America as well.<br>This new edition includes an introductory essay by Fernando Coronil that provides a contrapuntal reading of the relationship between Ortiz&#x2019;s book and its original introduction by the renowned anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski. Arguing for a distinction between theory production and canon formation, Coronil demonstrates the value of Ortiz&#x2019;s book for anthropology as well as Cuban, Caribbean, and Latin American studies, and shows Ortiz to be newly relevant to contemporary debates about modernity, postmodernism, and postcoloniality.<br></p><p>&#34;The first and only comprehensive study of the West Indian people. Ortiz ushered the Caribbean into the thought of the twentieth century and kept it there.&#34; --C. L. R. James<p>Fernando Ortiz (1881&#x2013;1969) was one of Cuba&#x2019;s most influential public intellectuals. His vast work on Cuban culture includes the five-volume work, <i>Los instrumentos de la m�sica afrocubana</i>. Fernando Coronil is Assistant Professor of Anthropology and History at the University of Michigan.</p></p><h2>Isaiah 40-66 (Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture, OT Volume 11)</h2><p>No book of the Old Testament is more frequently quoted in the New than Isaiah, and no portion of Isaiah is more frequently quoted in the New than the typologically fertile soil of Isaiah 40-66. Still, as interpreted by the fathers, Isaiah presents a message that is far more soteriological than christological, leading readers to a deeper understanding of God&#39;s judgment and salvation. Isaiah 40-66 provides us with the closest thing the Old Testament has to offer regarding a systematic theology. The excerpts included in this volume offer us a rich array of differing styles, principles and theological emphases from Theodoret of Cyr to Eusebius and Procopius, to Cyril of Alexandria, Jerome and Augustine. Readers will be enriched by the wide-ranging selections, some of which are translated here into English for the first time.</p><p><em>Volume editor</em><strong>Mark W.

Green, American Reference Books Annual, 2006, Volume 37)<br><br>"Contemporary Christians would do well to draw the hermeneutical circle broadly enough to include not only cross-cultural voices from around the world but also the voices to be found in the Ancient Christian Commentary series. This is an excellent sermon-preparation resource for pastors." (Christian Century, May 2, 2006)<br><br>"All who are interested in the interpretation of the Bible will welcome the forthcoming multivolume series Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture. Here the insights of scores of early church fathers will be assembled and made readily available for significant passages throughout the Bible and the Apocrypha. It is hard to think of a more worthy ecumenical project to be undertaken by InterVarsity Press." (Bruce M. Metzger, professor emeritus of New Testament, Princeton Theological Seminary)<br><br>"For those who think that church history began around 1941, when their pastor was born, this commentary will be a great surprise. Christians throughout the centuries have read the biblical text and nursed their spirits with it and then applied it to their lives. These commentaries reflect that the witness of the Holy Spirit was present in his church throughout the centuries. As a result, we can profit by allowing the ancient Christians to speak to us today." (Haddon Robinson, Harold John Ockenga Distinguished Professor of Preaching, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary)<br><br>"There is no shortage of new books on the market and it may be a surprise to some to see IVP producing the Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture series. But, bearing in mind C. S. Lewis's admonition, 'It is a good rule, after reading a new book, never to allow yourself another new one till you have read an old one in between,' this series will fill a great need that many of us may not even be aware of--the need to read those who have gone before us." (D. Stuart Briscoe)<br><br>"We speak abstractly in scholarly circles of the need to transcend looking at Christianity through the spectrum of modern presuppositions. This series, based on the commentaries of early Christians, gives us a concrete way to do this. It's a great idea." (Don S. Browning, Alexander Campbell Professor of Ethics and Social Sciences, The Divinity School, University of Chicago)<br><br>"The Scriptures have been read with love and attention for nearly two thousand years, and listening to the voice of believers from previous centuries opens us to unexpected insight and deepened faith. Those who studied Scripture in the centuries closest to its writing, the centuries during and following persecution and martyrdom, speak with particular authority. The Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture will bring to life the truth that we are invisibly surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses." (Frederica Mathewes-Green, commentator, National Public Radio)<br><br>"Composed in the style of the great medieval <em>catenae,</em> this new anthology of patristic commentary on Holy Scripture, conveniently arranged by chapter and verse, will be a valuable resource for prayer, study and proclamation. By calling attention to the rich Christian heritage preceding the separations between East and West and between Protestant and Catholic, this series will perform a major service to the cause of ecumenism."

Jessica's stepfather, Ezra, patted his stomach while the rest of Jessica and Sam Morgan's guests smiled and laughed.<br><br> There were only ten around the table this year, but enough food for twenty, Jessica decided, surveying the leftovers. Family holidays were often at her house, and there were often many more guests. But their Thanksgiving dinner had been quiet and relaxed this year with just her mother and stepfather; her sister, Emily, and her husband, Dan, and their younger daughter, Jane.

Lily, Jessica's youngest, headed back to the kitchen, eager to help.<br><br> "I hope you didn't forget the stomach antacids either." Jessica's mother, Lillian, turned to her husband.

Lily returned from the kitchen and placed a carton of vanilla ice cream and a chrome scoop on the table next to Ezra. "Mrs. Gibson read us a book about it."<br><br> "Thank you, Mrs. Gibson." Ezra ladled a generous lump of ice cream on his apple pie and picked up his spoon. "Let us honor our brave Pilgrim forefathers."<br><br> Just as Lillian seemed poised to for another volley, Sam lifted his glass. "And let us honor the cook. We may not keep everyone here for&nbsp; three days, but I bet we've had the best Thanksgiving feast in town."<br><br> "Hear, hear. To the cook," Dan echoed.<br><br> Jessica blushed. "Correction-the many cooks. Thanks to Emily and Jane, for their side dishes and the pudding. And Tyler," she added, smiling at her middle child. "He made the sweet potatoes and the pumpkin pie entirely on his own."<br><br> Tyler glowed with pride. It was becoming apparent that he had both interest and talent in the kitchen, and was even considering a career in that direction.<br><br> "Nice job, Ty." Darrell, Jessica's eldest, home from college for the long weekend, reached over and ruffled Tyler's hair. "We should call you Iron Chef."<br><br> Lillian raised her glass then leaned toward her husband. "What does that mean? Iron Chef?"<br><br> "A cooking show, dear. On TV," Ezra explained.<br><br> "I thought so. All these people cooking on television. I don't get the point," Lillian murmured. "In my day, you ate what was set in front of you. No fuss or fanfare."<br><br> "Thankfully, that day has passed," Sam said. "Before I forget, there's another part to my toast. Only about Jessica."<br><br> Jessica knew what was coming. She stared at her plate and took a breath. She and Sam had debated all morning whether or not to share her news today. Sam had been eager to tell the rest of the family, but she had felt unsure. He had promised he would leave it to her. It was her news to tell. Or not tell, if she chose.<br><br> She also knew Sam could never keep a secret. It was one of the things she loved about him-he was always so forthright and honest. But it was not an endearing trait at this particular moment. "Jessica has some news," Sam announced. "Right, honey?"<br><br> Finally, he looked at her.<br><br> Jessica tried to telegraph her displeasure to the far end of the table where he sat. But all eyes were on her. There was no avoiding it.<br><br> "Don't tell me. You're pregnant." Her mother practically groaned the words.<br><br> Jessica almost laughed. "Three is enough for me, Mother. And I'm a bit past that stage."<br><br> "Who knows these days? Movie stars seem to be having babies well into their senior years," Lillian observed.<br><br> "That might be true. But not me."<br><br> Emily had poured herself more coffee but didn't touch the cup. "What is it, Jess? Please tell us. I can hardly stand the suspense."<br><br> Jessica smiled and took a deep breath. But before she could speak, Lily interrupted. "Mommy started an animal shelter. We're going to take care of animals that are homeless."<br><br> "What a nice idea. You have plenty of property here, and you've always loved animals. Especially the strays." Emily smiled softly. "Remember that stray cat you found when we moved to the house on Providence Street?"<br><br> Jessica did remember. But she was surprised that Emily did.<br><br> "Don't remind me," Lillian said. "The minute your sister showed that mangy creature attention, it set up shop under the porch and had a boatload of kittens." Leave it to her mother to blame a poor stray cat for seeking shelter for her offspring. "It took us all summer to give those kittens away. Are you really eager to go through all that again . . . and again? That's quite a time-consuming hobby."<br><br> Jessica twisted her hands in her lap under the table, a nervous habit, perfected during endless and often stressful meetings at the bank. Sam gave her look. If she didn't tell all of her news, he would.<br><br> "It's not going to be a hobby, Mother. I mean, not any longer. I'm leaving the bank. I'm going to rescue animals full-time."<br><br> Jessica paused, her gaze sweeping over the surprised expressions around the table. Her relatives looked something just short of stunned.<br><br> Her niece Jane recovered the fastest. "I think that's great, Aunt Jess. You have so many pets already. I don't think it will be much different around here at all."<br><br> Jessica smiled, grateful for the vote of confidence. "I don't think so either, Janie. Though we do have plans to build some stalls in the barn and fence off different sections of the property."<br><br> "You'd be surprised. A lot of animals don't get along. Goats and sheep, for instance," Sam offered.<br><br> Her mother stared at him, her lips a tight line. "Is that all you have to say?" She turned to Jessica, her gaze withering. "You quit your job at the bank, manager of the loan department. In a few more years, bank manager, to be sure. You tossed all that in the . . . dung heap, let us say, to fuss over a pack of stray animals?"<br><br> "I don't expect you to understand, Mother. Please don't try to change my mind," Jessica said. "It's all settled. I've turned in my notice and started taking in more animals."<br><br> Lillian pressed her hand to her chest and took a deep breath. Ezra leaned toward his wife, looking concerned.<br><br> "Now, Lily . . . don't get yourself into a state. Jessica's old enough to know her own mind."<br><br> "Sounds like she's lost her mind to me," Lillian retorted. "And what do you think of this?" she asked Sam. "You don't care if your wife ruins a perfectly good career for some midlife, wildlife crisis?"<br><br> Jessica watched Sam rub the back of his neck, a gesture he used to buy time and gather his patience. "I'm totally in favor of the career change, Lillian," he said. "Jessica has wanted to take this step for a long time. She's certainly paid her dues at that bank. She's just not happy working there anymore. At this stage of her life, I think she should work at a career that's fulfilling and makes her happy."<br><br> "Fine words," Lillian replied. "What about her paycheck? I assume it takes two salaries to run this house and take care of your children. Jessica certainly won't make the same income running an animal shelter-if she makes anything at all from the endeavor."<br><br> "Mother, really. That's none of your business," Emily cut in.<br><br> "I'm just curious. Since I happen to be the person most likely to be asked for a loan, if the need should arise," Lillian added.<br><br> Jessica thought Sam's temper was going to flare at the dig. But to Jessica's great relief, he sat back and shrugged.<br><br> "It's nice to know you're ready to lend a helping hand, Lillian," Sam said, intentionally misinterpreting his mother-in-law's words. "But there won't be any need. My business is doing well, thank goodness. And we have plenty of savings. We know it will take time for the shelter to turn a profit. We've already planned for that."<br><br> "Not worried about making ends meet?" Lillian sounded as if she didn't believe him. "Well, time will tell. That's all I have to say."<br><br> "Yes, it will," Sam agreed.<br><br> Jessica smiled at her husband, meeting his dark eyes with a look of thanks. And love. All her annoyance about the way he had given up her secret faded. She was immensely grateful for Sam's understanding and the way he had encouraged her to follow through on this "someday" plan-to open and run her own shelter. Not just dabble with the work on the weekends.<br><br> Emily cut a slice of pumpkin pie and passed it to her husband. "Life is short. We must follow our bliss, whether it leads to Thanksgiving pie . . . or caring for God's creatures, great and small. Congratulations, Jessica. I think we should toast to your new career and great success."<br><br> "Yes, Aunt Jessica. That's very exciting news," Jane said.<br><br> Everyone raised their glasses again. Everyone but her mother, Jessica noticed. "Go ahead. Clink away. I won't toast to this harebrained idea. No pun intended," Lillian added.<br><br> "Oh, Lily, don't be a spoilsport," Ezra muttered.<br><br> Her mother ignored him. "I'll give it a month. Maybe two. By the new year, you'll regret this impetuous decision, Jessica. But by then it will be too late."<br><br> Was her mother right? Jessica hoped not. She shook off the doubts her mother had just planted and reminded herself that she couldn't let her mother's dire predictions get under her skin.<br><br> "Think what you like, Mother," Jessica replied calmly. "By the new year, I'm sure I'll be thanking my lucky stars I had the courage to take this leap . . . and thanking my husband for encouraging me every step of the way."<br><br> "Aww, Jess. That's so sweet." Sam smiled at her from the far end of the table.<br><br> "Hear, hear . . . to supportive husbands, everywhere," Dan said, toasting again. Just as Jessica clinked glasses with her brother-in-law, she heard her mother shriek and saw her tilt back in her chair, her arms raised in alarm.<br><br> "Good gravy-what's going on?" Ezra turned to his wife.<br><br> "Something is crawling up the tablecloth." Her mother stared down at her lap and Jessica saw a soft, gray head emerge. One of the kittens she was keeping had escaped the enclosure in the family room.<br><br> While everyone laughed, it scampered in confusion and fright, straight through her mother's dessert dish, leaving pumpkin-colored footprints on the tablecloth.<br><br> "For heaven's sake. Don't just sit there. Someone catch it," Lillian snapped.<br><br> Several swipes were made but the kitten eluded capture. Finally, it settled on the table, cowering in a small ball. Lily gently lifted the cat, cooing softly as she removed it from the table, then cradled it to her chest.<br><br> "She must have wiggled through the enclosure. Lily will put her back," Jessica explained, wondering if there were any other escapees on the loose.<br><br> Jessica expected her mother to reply with some tart comment, but Lillian just pushed her dessert plate aside. "I'd like another slice of pie, please. On a fresh dish. This one has cat footprints."<br><br> "Coming right up," Jessica replied, barely able to keep a straight face.<br><br> She knew it wasn't going to be easy, this new path she had chosen. A path "less traveled by," as the poet Robert Frost had written. But she was so eager to set off and put her whole heart into it. Nothing could dim her high hopes.<br><br> �Everything�s ready. Finally. I didn�t expect the turkey to take so long,� Jean Whitman admitted to her mother. �It�s only a turkey breast. I thought that would be enough for just the two of us.�<br><br> "More than enough. It seems a waste to do all this cooking for just two people. Though I will miss the dark meat."<br><br> Jean had forgotten her mother's preference. Should have bought some drumsticks. Oh well, next time.<br><br> Cynthia had refused any help walking from her bedroom to the dining room, though Jean felt anxious, watching every step as her mother maneuvered her walker. When her mother reached the table, Jean pulled out a chair and waited to help her mother sit.<br><br> "My place is on the other side, don't you remember?"<br><br> "Yes, of course. I'll move your place setting."<br><br> Jean had remembered, but the other side of the table was so much harder to reach with the walker. But she patiently took the dish and silverware to the spot her mother preferred, then waited as her mother made her way around.<br><br> Jean had set the table with good china and silver flatware. The dishes, rescued from the china closet, had been full of dust, and the silver had needed polish. She had also bought a centerpiece of autumn-colored flowers and found candles for the silver holders.<br><br> She thought her mother would appreciate the special touches. Cynthia was an artist-or had been. Jean also thought the extra fuss might lift her spirits a bit. But her mother didn't seem to notice anything special about the table. She opened her napkin and took a sip of water from a crystal glass with no change of expression. She could have been eating off a tray in her bedroom, Jean thought.<br><br> Jean returned to the kitchen and carried out the many dishes she had prepared. It did seem like a lot for two, but they would definitely use the leftovers. Jean's mother had not been a very good cook. She was more interested in her painting and would toss together a hasty supper after hours in her studio-often sandwiches and soup from a can or pasta with bottled sauce.<br><br> But Jean loved to cook. She was always taking classes and gleaning tips from TV shows and the Internet. She had already found some interesting recipes for Thanksgiving leftovers and would try a few this week. She wasn't just visiting Cape Light for the holiday but had moved down from Portland, Maine, to take care of her mother indefinitely, taking over the cooking and housekeeping from the aides who stopped in daily.</p><h2>The Babysitter at Rest</h2><p>Fiction. Five stories&#x2015;several as long as novellas&#x2015;introduce the world to Jen George, a writer whose furiously imaginative new voice calls to mind Donald Barthelme and Leonora Carrington no less than Kathy Acker and Chris Kraus. In "Guidance/The Party," an ethereal alcoholic "Guide" in robes and flowing hair appears to help a thirty- three-year-old woman prepare a party for her belated adulthood; "Take Care of Me Forever" tragically lambasts the medical profession as a ship of fools afloat in loneliness and narcissism; "Instruction" chronicles a season in an unconventional art school called The Warehouse, where students divide their time between orgies, art critiques, and burying dead racehorses. Combining slapstick, surrealism, erotica, and social criticism, Jen George's sprawling creative energy belies the secret precision and unexpected tenderness of everything she writes.</p><p>Jen George was born in Thousand Oaks, California. She lives and works in New York City. THE BABYSITTER AT REST (Dorothy, a publishing project, 2016) is her first book.<strong>"Our Favorite Books from 2016" @ <em>The Believer</em></strong><br><strong>"Best Short Story Collections of 2016" @ <em>Electric Literature</em></strong><br><strong>"Best Fiction Books, 2016" @ <em>Entropy</em></strong><br><strong>"Our 20 Favorite Books of 2016" @ <em>The A.V. Club</em></strong><br>"This brilliantly caustic d�but collection of stories is an attack on the pieties of contemporary social life and the niceties of traditional fiction."&#x2015;<strong>The New Yorker</strong><br><br>"<em>The Babysitter at Rest</em> is an undeniably great debut collection of stories. George's writing is funny, courageous, smart, surreal, seductive, and terrifyingly vulnerable."&#x2015;<strong>Electric Literature</strong><br><br>"We all know it's commitment to something absurd that makes things funny&#x2015;but in <em>The Babysitter at Rest</em> Jen George commits to scenarios that are not just absurd but weird in a deeply true, 'unspeakable-underpinning-of-reality' sort of way. And thus her commitment is both funny and kind of spiritual at the same time&#x2015;and by laughing, you're admitting this female inner universe exists. And that kind of changes everything."&#x2015;<strong>Miranda July, author of <em>The First Bad Man: A Novel</em></strong><br><br>"I'm so happy this collection exists. I feel drunk with love for these stories. They're so funny and weird and true."&#x2015;<strong>Sheila Heti, author of <em>How Should a Person Be?</em></strong><br><br>"George goes there again and again, combining the profane and the pathetic with a rarely seen energy. When's the last time you read an opening line this charged? 'On a bed in the emergency room, being pumped full of morphine and oxycodone, vomiting, then being pumped full of the same medications, I recall the ways I've always been.' (That little information about George is available&#x2015;she was born in California and lives in New York&#x2015;only heightens the appeal; her work stands alone.)"&#x2015;<strong>The A.V. Club (Grade: A)</strong><br><br>"Reading <em>The Babysitter at Rest</em> is an immersion into a hidden world. It's a place which is at first recognizable, before it becomes completely warped. Jen George has a way of bending the narrative which is distinctly her own. Her stories are at once poignant and disciplined in their abstraction, and hilarious in their inappropriate and reckless abandon."&#x2015;<strong>Matthew Barney</strong><br><br>"George writes with an ear for raw thought patterns; her renderings of characters reproduced by their preferences and reduced to sad adulthoods are exquisite."&#x2015;<strong>The Village Voice</strong><br><br>"A brilliant and surprising debut collection of short fiction."&#x2015;<strong>BOMB</strong><br><br>"With a weird, beautiful energy, George explores the challenges of woman-being: singlehood, self-doubt, motherhood, the dismaying fact of aging, the (dis)ability to love. A modern-day Jane Bowles, George engages these mysteries in prose that is funny, charming, dark, and insightful."&#x2015;<strong>Deb Olin Unferth, author of <em>Revolution: The Year I Fell in Love and Went to Join the War</em></strong></p><h2>George Stacey and the Creation of American Chic</h2><p>The history of interior design is punctuated by a few legends-Billy Baldwin, Sister Parish-and should include trailblazing decorator George Stacey. When George Stacey shot to prominence in the 1930s with projects for socialite Frances Cheney and style priestess Diana Vreeland, the audacity of his work caught the eye of <i>Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Town and Country</i>, and <i>House &amp; Garden</i>. An appealing nonchalance and irreverence, combined with erudition, a flair for color, and an innate grasp of balance, scale, and proportion, produced rooms that were surprising as well as sophisticated. Balancing modern aesthetics and modern living with a lifelong passion for French classicism ensured that Stacey designs were both of the moment and enduring. <br><br>For the next forty years, he deftly produced a string of stylish rooms for his stylish clientele. While the ground rules of Stacey's approach remained constant, he captured the nuances of mood and culture of an exceptionally dynamic era and established a design vocabulary that defined American chic in the American century and that endures, glitteringly, to this day.</p><p>Maureen Footer studied French decorative arts and design at the Ecole du Louvre. She worked at McMillen Inc. and Molyneux before establishing her own design firm. Legendary American decorator Mario Buatta is internationally renowned for his &#34;Undecorated Look.&#34;"His vision defined the backdrop of Caf� Society and reverberates to this day." <i>Veranda</i><br><br>"Combining lofty antiques with humble pieces, society decorator George Stacey pioneered the 'high-low' look--in the 1930s."&nbsp; <i>The Wall Street Journal</i><br><br>"Arguably the most important decorator since Elsie de Wolfe... the book examines Stacey's life and work alongside chic images of his most famous clients, including Diana Vreeland, Babe Paley, Grace Kelly..."&nbsp; <i>The Houston Chronicle</i><br><br>"And as for the Society women who were his cherished clients, they too have gone into the world of night.&nbsp; As one of Proust's biographers has noted, "Even the greatest hostess is forgotten when the last of her guests dies."<br>Now comes Maureen Footer, a decorator and a worthy successor to Stacey, to place him on his proper pedestal.&nbsp; It's not a small one, and this is not a slight book.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>George Stacey and the&nbsp;Creation of American&nbsp;Chic</b>&nbsp;is wide-ranging, almost scholarly, correctly connecting the dots between design and culture."&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesse Kornbluth, <i>The Head Butler</i><br><br>"Stacey had a lasting impact on 20th-century decorating--in addition to an impressive client list."--<i>New York Cottages and Gardens</i></p><h2>MASH: An Army Surgeon in Korea</h2><p>When North Korean forces invaded South Korea on June 25, 1950, Otto Apel was a surgical resident living in Cleveland, Ohio, with his wife and three young children. A year later he was chief surgeon of the 8076th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital constantly near the front lines in Korea. Immediately upon arriving in camp, Apel performed 80 hours of surgery. His feet swelled so badly that he had to cut his boots off, and he saw more surgical cases in those three and a half days than he would have in a year back in Cleveland. There were also the lighter moments. When a Korean came to stay at the 8076th, word of her beauty spread so rapidly that they needed MPs just to direct traffic. Apel also recalls a North Korean aviator, nicknamed &#34;Bedcheck Charlie,&#34; who would drop a phony grenade from an open-cockpit biplane, a story later filmed for the television series. He also tells of the day the tent surrounding the women&#39;s shower was &#34;accidentally&#34; blown off by a passing helicopter. In addition to his own story, Apel details the operating conditions, workload, and patient care at the MASH units while revealing the remarkable advances made in emergency medical care. MASH units were the first hospitals designed for operations close to the front lines, and from this particularly difficult vantage, their medical staffs were responsible for innovations in the use of antibiotics and blood plasma and in arterial repair. On film and television, MASH doctors and nurses have been portrayed as irreverent and having little patience with standard military procedures. In this powerful memoir, Apel reveals just how realistic these portrayals were.</p><p>"This memoir is about war, but it addresses a different aspect of war: the struggle of men and women in the U.S. Army who were called upon to expend their efforts and their lives preserving human life during this vicious combat."--McCormick (SC) Messenger <p>"The reader is spared nothing, and at times I shared with the authors an understanding of the emotional effect medical work in a war zone can cause."--BMJ </p><p>"Provides a close look at the way a MASH functioned. . . . The Apels have produced a well written and useful book."--Southern Historian </p><p>"A superb book. . . . Reading this fine nonfiction account of an army surgeon in the Korean War will make you wish you had been there treating casualties. It did me!"--Journal of the American Medical Association </p><p>&#x201c;The authors have skillfully blended the surgeon&#x2019;s personal experiences into the bigger picture of military medicine, providing the reader with an informative and interesting account of the MASH and its impact during the Korean War.&#x201d;&#x2014;Military </p><p>&#x201c;Exposes the true nature of the Korean conflict from a medical perspective. . . .

These carved representations of ceremonial figures taking part in celebration of the Kachina religion are highly collected by Indian and white peoples alike. This book serves to explain, compare, and present the variety of dolls that are found through color pictures, line drawings and a concise text. The carvers are given a great deal of recognition throughout the book as the discussion covers the environment, tools, and prominence of these artists. An appendix lists 495 living artists. An introduction is by Frederick Dockstader, former director to the Museum of the American Indian in New York. Mr. Bromberg, a trader among the Hopi, shares his accumulated respect for the culture and people who produce them. His chapters evolved to answer questions by collectors and gallery workers. The result is a first-hand analysis of this contemporary and still changing art form that has both religious and commercial impact on the Hopi carvers. Only a trusted, sympathetic student of the Hopi culture could have compiled the background interpretations of the dolls and won the respect of the carvers.</p><p>Mr. Bromberg&#39;s sensitive scholarship brings insight to this art form and should inspire the artists as well as the collectors. Living in Albuquerque with his wife, Mr. Bromberg makes frequent and lengthy visits to Hopi land.</p><h2>Uproot: Travels in 21st-Century Music and Digital Culture</h2><p><p>In 2001 Jace Clayton was an unknown DJ who recorded a three-turntable, sixty-minute mix and put it online to share with friends. Within weeks, Gold Teeth Thief became an international calling card, whisking Clayton away to play a nightclub in Zagreb, a gallery in Osaka, a former brothel in Sao Paolo, and the American Museum of Natural History. Just as the music world made its fitful, uncertain transition from analog to digital, Clayton found himself on the front lines of creative upheavals of art production in the twenty-first century globalized world.</p><p><i>Uproot</i> is a guided tour of this newly-opened cultural space. With humor, insight, and expertise, Clayton illuminates the connections between a Congolese hotel band and the indie-rock scene, Mexican rodeo teens and Israeli techno, and Whitney Houston and the robotic voices is rural Moroccan song, and offers an unparalleled understanding of music in the digital age.</p></p><p><b>Jace Clayton</b>'s essays have appeared in <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>Bidoun</i>, <i>Frieze</i>,<i> </i>and<i> FADER</i>, where he is a regular contributor.

He lives and works in New York City.<p>"[Clayton's] frank curiosity and broad musical tastes form the basis for this terrific book about the globalization of ideas in our age of 'digital superabundance' . . . Humor and humility infuse descriptions of a street dance party in Kingston, Jamaica; traffic in Cairo; and a smoke-filled music store in Beirut.

He looks at the world and makes culture from gorgeously odd angles&#x2015;every sentence of this book is a gem.&#x201d; &#x2015;Elizabeth Alexander</p><p>"Some people think global music culture is homogenous, but it's not. Everything is mutating at a high speed and even higher bitrate. For any real insight into why and how it&#x2019;s happening, it's essential to be part of it and to document with the eye of a creator.

Take a break from <i>Pitchfork</i>, expand your horizons, and read this book. <i>Uproot</i> is a cosmopolitan clarion call, full of passion and insight as infectious as a pop hook.&#x201d; &#x2015;Astra Taylor</p><p>&#x201c;The revolution will be auto-tuned. Jace Clayton shows how technology disrupts not only the music industry but musicians themselves.

The title story is a small, sad masterpiece, about a woman holidaying alone in an Italian hotel. &#34;A dazzling collection of short stories&#34; - &#34;Sunday Times&#34;.</p><p><i>After Rain</i> consists of 12 short stories of love and disillusion by one of the current masters of fiction, William Trevor.

On his return to America, Melville would write <i>Moby-Dick</i>. <i>Melville: A Novel </i>imagines what happened in between: the adventurous writer fleeing London for the country, wrestling with an angel, falling in love with an Irish nationalist, and, finally, meeting the angel&#x2019;s challenge&#x2014;to express man&#x2019;s fate by writing the novel that would become his masterpiece.<br><br> Eighty years after it appeared in English, <i>Moby-Dick</i> was translated into French for the first time by the Proven�al novelist Jean Giono and his friend Lucien Jacques. The publisher persuaded Giono to write a preface, granting him unusual latitude. The result was this literary essay,&nbsp;<i>Melville: A Novel</i>&#x2014;part biography, part philosophical rumination, part romance, part unfettered fantasy. Paul Eprile&#x2019;s expressive translation of this intimate homage brings the exchange full circle.<br><br>Paul Eprile was a co-winner of the French-American Foundation's 2018 Translation Prize for his translation of <i>Melville</i>.</p><p><b>Jean Giono</b> (1895&#x2013;1970) was born and lived most of his life in the town of Manosque, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence. Largely self-educated, he started working as a bank clerk at the age of sixteen and reported for military service when World War I broke out. He saw action in several battles, including Verdun, and was one of only two members of his company to survive. After the war, he returned to his job and family in Manosque and became a vocal, lifelong pacifist. After the success of <i>Hill</i>, which won the Prix Brentano, he left the bank and began to publish prolifically. During World War II Giono&#x2019;s outspoken pacifism led some to accuse him, unjustly, of defeatism and of collaboration with the Nazis; after France&#x2019;s liberation in 1944, he was imprisoned and held without charges. Despite being blacklisted after his release, Giono continued writing and achieved renewed success. He was elected to the Acad�mie Goncourt in 1954.<br><br><b> Paul Eprile</b> is a longtime publisher (Between the Lines, Toronto), as well as a poet and translator.

Moreover, theology matters: Without serious reflection on their worldview, ultimate commitments, and lifestyle, North American Christians cannot hope to contribute to ensuring the &#34;good life&#34; for people or the planet. To live differently we must think differently. McFague&#39;s has therefore written primer in theology. It helps Christians assess their own religious story in light of the larger Christian tradition and the felt needs of the planet. At once an apology for an ecologically driven theology and a model for how theology itself might be expressed, her work is expressly crafted to bring people into the practice of religious reflection as a form of responsible Christian practice in the world. McFague shows the reader how articulating one&#39;s personal religious story and credo can lead directly into contextual analysis, unfolding of theological concepts, and forms of Christian practice. In lucid prose she offers creative discussions of revelation, the reigning economic worldview (and its ecological alternative), and how a planetary theology might approach classical areas of God and the world, Christ and salvation, and life in the Spirit. Enticing readers into serious self-assessment and creative commitment, McFague&#39;s new work encourages and models a theological practice that &#34;gives glory to God by loving the world.&#34;</p><p>From the Introduction (pre-publication version): <p>I have written each of my books in an effort to make up for deficiencies in the last one. Life Abundant is no exception. After completing Super, Natural Christians, subtitled &#x201c;How We Should Love Nature,&#x201d; I realized love was not enough. I realized that we middle-class North American Christians are destroying nature, not because we do not love it, but because of the way we live: our ordinary, taken-for-granted high-consumer lifestyle. I realized that the matter of loving nature was a deep, complex, tricky question involving greed, indifference, and denial. </p><p>So I have set about trying to rectify the inadequacies of my last book with yet another (inadequate) book. The thesis of this one is that we North American middle-class Christians need to live differently in order to love nature and to live differently, we need to think differently&#x2014;especially about ourselves and who we are in the scheme of things. And by &#x201c;think differently&#x201d; I do not mean our conscious, &#x201c;for publication&#x201d; thoughts about ourselves, but the largely unconscious picture of who we are that is the silent partner in all our behavior and decisions. These world-pictures or worldviews are formed by many factors, one of which is the religious assumptions about human beings that operate implicitly in a culture. The current dominant American worldview, a legacy from the Protestant Reformation, the Enlightenment, and eighteenth-century economic theory, is that we are individuals with the right to happiness, especially the happiness of the consumer-style &#x201c;abundant life.&#x201d; The m! arket ideology has become our way of life, almost our religion, telling us who we are (consumers) and what the goal of life is (making money). In report after report from the United Nations Development Programme and similar organizations, the grim results of this lifestyle are becoming apparent: a widening gap between the rich and the poor as well as the unraveling of the irreplaceable life systems of the planet. Is this loving nature&#x2014;or our neighbor? </p><p>I don&#x2019;t think so. I realized that a basic deficiency in my last book was the neglect of economics (partly because I thought it was too difficult to understand). There is, however, no avoiding it&#x2014;and what ordinary people need to know is not its technical side, but the assumptions and results of consumer-oriented economic theory. We do not love nature or care for two-thirds of the world&#x2019;s people if we who are 20% of the population use more than 80% of the world&#x2019;s energy. There is not enough energy on the planet for all people to live as we do (and increasingly, most want to) or for the planet to remain in working order if all try to live this way. We are on a path that is unjust to others and unsustainable to the planet. But most of us do not know (or acknowledge) this; we keep ourselves in denial because we like this way of life, and our economic system and government collude with us. We middle-class North Americans are addicted to the consumer lifestyle, even if it means depri! ving others and putting the planet in jeopardy. </p><p>Life Abundant is not a feel-good read, at least not initially. Reading it will probably be like writing it was. Eventually, I could imagine another abundant life, one that I found deeply satisfying. However, the route to it for folks like me and you (the presumed middle-class North American reader) involves limitation and sacrifice, a radically different view of abundance. It involves re-imagining the good life in just and sustainable ways. Why is this satisfying? I invite you to read on and discover, but most simply, for me, because I sleep better at night, thinking of another possible way to live, one in which most of the world&#x2019;s people would have the necessary basics and the planet could remain more or less intact. </p><p>So, this book is about imagining another way to live &#x201c;abundantly&#x201d; on planet Earth. The route to this other way, to what I call the ecological economic model, is a bit circuitous because I want to show how I got there. I believe that all Christians must have a working theology, one that can actually function in their personal, professional, and public lives. Gradually, over many years I have developed one and it is a theology for just and sustainable planetary living. I will share my theological journey as a possible case study for readers who might want to undertake a similar one. I decided to write the book this way in part to de-mystify theology: there is nothing special about theology&#x2014;every Christian has one. The question is how good, appropriate, and functional is it? </p><p>One way to test your theology&#x2014;those deeply-held, perhaps subconscious beliefs about God and the world that profoundly influence your actions&#x2014;is to examine it. This is an old Christian practice, epitomized in Augustine&#x2019;s plea, &#x201c;For Thy mercies&#x2019; sake, O Lord my God, tell me what Thou art to me.&#x201d; One undertakes a contemplative exercise for the purpose of living with God and for neighbor more appropriately and fully. It is a way of doing theology that begins in experience and ends in a conversion to a new way of being in the world. Developing a working theology is not &#x201c;doing one&#x2019;s thing&#x201d; or finding a comfortable view of God; on the contrary, it is undergoing the discipline of the examination of conscience for the purpose of living the Christian life more deeply and fittingly in one&#x2019;s own time. Needless to say, if this exercise does result in a view of abundant living, it will not be the popular contemporary one. Perhaps Dorothy Day sums it up best when she wrote: &#x201c;I wanted life an! d I wanted the abundant life. I wanted it for others too&#x201d; (italics added). </p><p>This book, then, has a dual aim: to describe a Christian theology of the good life and to show how I have come to this theology. Needless to say, this is only one such theology. Whether it is helpful toward attaining a just, sustainable planet and whether it is Christian is for readers to judge. At the very least, I hope it helps you work out your own theology.</p>Sallie McFague is Carpenter Professor of Theology and former Dean of Vanderbilt Divinity School, Nashville, Tennessee.

Got this thin, cold stop-�start drizzle weeping down out of a paprika sky.<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t have the detail on it; I&#x2019;d been too busy. Some newly written subroutine was what I&#x2019;d heard, something consulted in from the edgy end of the industry, coded and cooked and cut loose somewhere up there amid the vast shifting gossamer layers that keep the Valley warm. Must have had some solid marketing muscle behind it, too, because the streets were crowded for a midweek night. When the rain kicked in, it felt like the whole city jammed up to watch. Everywhere you turned&#x2014;�people stopping to crane their necks and gawk.<br><br>I spared the sky a sour glance of my own, didn&#x2019;t stop. Shoulder on instead, keep the pace through stalled knots of rubberneckers and eco-�geeks talking shit. Anyone looking to actually get wet behind this shit would likely be waiting a while. In the pushy seduction of the marketing, people tend to forget&#x2014;�nothing falls fast on Mars. And new code or not, this attempt at downpour wasn&#x2019;t going to be breaking any basic laws of physics. Mostly, the promised rain just floated and blew around overhead, scornful of the halfhearted gravity, tinged in the dying light to a blood-�red spray.<br><br>Pretty to look at, sure. But some of us had places to be.<br><br>The Strip loomed around me&#x2014;�five-�story Settlement-�era facades in scarred antique nanocrete, repair protocols long exhausted. These days the inert surfaces are lathered by decades of storm wind and grit into something that looks more like flat expanses of coral at low tide than anything you&#x2019;d call human-�made. Back in the day, the COLIN engineers were all about huddling down&#x2014;�they ran the build either side of a broad channel dug out between the exposed foundations, mirror-�image structures rising on either side. Sixty meters wide, that channel, and three kilometers long, bent just a little out of true to take advantage of existing fault-�line geology in the Valley floor. Once upon a time it housed hydroponic gardens and manicured recreational spaces for the original colonists, all of it roofed in under glass. Parks, velodromes, a couple of small amphitheaters, and a sports field&#x2014;�even, they tell me, a swimming pool or three. Free access for all.<br><br>Imagine that.<br><br>Now the roof is gone, and so is the rest of it. Knocked down, torn out, cleared away. What they left in its place is a scuffed and littered sunken boulevard, tangled up with barrows and street stalls, all vying to shift the cheapest product to the crowd. Get it while it&#x2019;s hot, people, get it now! Last season&#x2019;s discounted coding spikes, semismart jewelry, branded Marstech, faked or stolen&#x2014;�it&#x2019;d have to be at those prices&#x2014;�and fast food, lots of it, steaming from myriad different woks and pans. Street chemists hang about on the fringes, pushing Twenty Tailored Ways to Get Out of Your Head in a Hurry; street boys and girls stand at corners, flexing a more basic route to the same escape. You could argue, I guess, that you&#x2019;re still in a recreational space of sorts. But it&#x2019;s a pretty gaunt and garish spirit of fun that stalks the Strip these days, and if you ran into it, you wouldn&#x2019;t want to meet its eye.<br><br>For those chasing that particular ghost regardless, you reach bottom via long escalator tunnels hacked inelegantly right through the original structure&#x2014;�there&#x2019;s one at the end of most of the cross streets where they back up to the stretch of Settlement-�era build, hemming it in on both sides with architecture altogether less hunkered and hermetic, conceived for a generation that could suddenly Go Outside. The cross streets end, the expansive aspirational leap and soar of the Outdoor New butts up abruptly against the somber, ragged backsides of the Settlement Old. You step on the escalators under big cowled openings in the worn nanocrete, and the endless alloy belt ride carries you through and down.<br><br>Or&#x2014;�if you&#x2019;re new to Mars, fresh off the shuttle, or some kind of nostalgia freak&#x2014;�you do the loud tourist thing and ride the gargantuan antique cargo elevators at either end of the channel. Twinned thousand-�square-�meter loading platforms, still pistoning massively up and down like the breath in slow lungs, smooth as the day they were put in. Got these tacky fake-�historical stand-�clear messages blaring out on a looped track from bullhorn speakers along the safety railing. Rotating yellow warning cherries, the whole deal. The grimy heavy engineering prowess of the old High Frontier, preserved today for your jaded delectation.<br><br>Either way&#x2014;�platforms or endlessly moving covered stairways&#x2014;�you&#x2019;re left with pretty much the same sensation. You&#x2019;re easing down slowly, sinking into the belly of something huge and probably hazardous to your health.<br><br>Fine by me.<br><br>I&#x2019;d taken the escalator down from the end of Crane Alley, which put me about a klick away from where I wanted to be&#x2014;�slow going with the weather geeks clogging up the flow. And as I came out under the exit cowl, against all the odds, there was some genuine street-�level rain to contend with. It slapped my face as I moved through the crowds; it dampened my collar. Put an unaccustomed beading of moisture on my brow and the backs of my hands. Felt pretty good, but then, so did everything else right now.<br><br>Three days awake and running-�hot.<br><br>Over my head, early lights were coming on behind long-�redundant storm slits in the upper levels of the build, hinting at sultry mysteries within. Club names and logos clung to the antique architecture like a plague of gigantic luminescent beetles and centipedes. And across the drizzling sky, the first of the &#x2019;branegels spread their almost invisible soap-�bubble wings. Silver flurries of preliminary static shivered down their surfaces, like coughing to clear your throat. The images shook out, and the long night&#x2019;s video pimping began.<br><br>I&#x2019;d thought maybe, with the shuttle in from Earth and just docked that morning, we&#x2019;d have some ultratripper montages or standard profile spots for Vector Red and Horkan Kumba Ultra. But tonight the rainmaker publicity led the parade&#x2014;�moody intense footage of taut young bodies cavorting on nighttime streets in a rainstorm the likes of which no one around here would ever get within 50 million kilometers of seeing for real. Thin dark clothing drenched through, ripped and torn, a kind of �favela-�chic thing, clinging to curves and declivities, molded round nipples teased erect, framing cold cuts and slices of water-�beaded flesh. Marketing copy bannered repeatedly across the pan-�and-�grab footage&#x2014;�<br><br>Particle Slam Dunk&#x2014;�Get Wet, Why Don&#x2019;t You!

A couple of centuries back, when they kicked off their efforts, you could reasonably have called them a special-�interest keiretsu. These days, that&#x2019;d be like pinning a badge that says lizard on a T.&nbsp;Rex. Kind of misses the scale of the thing. If it has to do with the human footprint anywhere in the solar system or transplanetary haulage and trade between, then COLIN owns it, runs it, sponsors it, or will do soon. Their capital flow is the lifeblood of the expansion; their co-�option of antique legal structure back on Earth is the overarching framework that holds it all up. And their supposed competitive market dynamics are no more real or significant than the posturing dance steps and face-�offs of those svelte young things up on &#x2019;branegel display in the fun and friendly rain.<br><br>Meantime, the rain&#x2014;�the real rain, back here in the real world&#x2014;�stuttered abruptly out. It blew away to nothing, left a long pregnant pause, then started in again, weeping slow. Hard to know if the new code was working well; it could have been running that staggered feed as part of an energy-�saving protocol, could have been teasing for effect, or could just be buggy as fuck. Eco-�code geeks stood around all along the Strip, squinting up into the sky, arguing it back and forth.<br><br>&#x201c;Toldya they&#x2019;d get it sorted. Particle Slam are solid, soak.

That's important when you have a grandfather who is constantly forgetting. And it's even more important when your grandfather can't care for you anymore and you have to go live with a foster family out in the country.<br><br>Prez is still learning to fit in at his new home when he answers the door to meet Sputnik&#x2014;a kid who is more than a little strange. First, he can hear what Prez is thinking. Second, he looks like a dog to everyone except Prez. Third, he can manipulate the laws of space and time. Sputnik, it turns out is an alien, and he's got a mission that requires Prez's help: the Earth has been marked for destruction, and the only way they can stop it is to&nbsp;come up with ten reasons why the&nbsp;planet should be saved.</p><p>Thus begins one of the most fun and eventful summers of Prez's life, as he and Sputnik set out on a journey to compile the most important list Prez has ever made&#x2014;and discover just what makes&nbsp;our world so remarkable.</p></p><p><p><strong>Frank Cottrell Boyce</strong> is the author of <em>Sputnik's Guide to Life on Earth</em>, <em>The Astounding Broccoli </em><em>Boy</em>, <em>Cosmic</em>, <em>Framed</em>, and <em>Millions</em>, the last of which was a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller and was made into a movie by Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle.

Frank is also a screenwriter, having penned the scripts for a number of feature films as well as the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics. He lives in Liverpool with his family.</p>Gr 4&#x2013;7&#x2014;Prez Mellows is a list expert. He's been making lists for years on sticky notes to help his granddad remember important life facts, such as "Prez is your grandson" and "Do not go out without trousers." His lists help save the planet when a space-traveling alien, Sputnik, shows up on Earth and enlists Prez's help to come up with 10 reasons Earth should be spared; otherwise, it will be shrunk to oblivion. To Prez, Sputnik looks like a boy wearing a kilt, a leather helmet, and flying goggles, but to everyone else, he looks like a dog. Selectively mute, Prez is trying to come to grips with being in a "temporary" foster home with a raucous family, while mistakenly thinking his granddad was taken away to prison rather than a nursing home. Cottrell Boyce (Millions; The Astounding Broccoli Boy) invites readers to suspend belief while going on a physics-defying, mind-bending adventure that's sure to appeal to a wide audience. When a motorized scooter becomes a getaway vehicle, Prez and Sputnik try to help Granddad retrieve lost memories, establish reasons why Earth should be saved, and, along the way, discover where they really belong and what is most important.

While the physical exercises of Hindu yoga are familiar to Westerners, the subtle metaphysics and refined methods of spiritual development that characterize Buddhist yoga are not yet well known.

Religious faith, patriotism, and the belief in human progress had all been called into question by the mass carnage experienced by both sides. Shell shocked and traumatized, the West faced a world it no longer recognized: the old order had collapsed, replaced by an age of machines. The world hurtled forward on gears and crankshafts, and terrifying new ideologies arose from the wreckage of past belief.<br><br>In <i>Fracture</i>, critically acclaimed historian Philipp Blom argues that in the aftermath of World War I, citizens of the West directed their energies inwards, launching into hedonistic, aesthetic, and intellectual adventures of self-discovery. It was a period of both bitter disillusionment and visionary progress. From Surrealism to Oswald Spengler's <i>The Decline of the West</i>; from Fritz Lang's <i>Metropolis</i> to theoretical physics, and from Art Deco to Jazz and the Charleston dance, artists, scientists, and philosophers grappled with the question of how to live and what to believe in a broken age. Morbid symptoms emerged simultaneously from the decay of World War I: progress and innovation were everywhere met with increasing racism and xenophobia. America closed its borders to European refugees and turned away from the desperate poverty caused by the Great Depression. On both sides of the Atlantic, disenchanted voters flocked to Communism and fascism, forming political parties based on violence and revenge that presaged the horror of a new World War.<br><br>Vividly recreating this era of unparalleled ambition, artistry, and innovation, Blom captures the seismic shifts that defined the interwar period and continue to shape our world today.<br></p><p><b>Philipp Blom</b> is the author of several award-winning books, including <i>A Wicked Company</i>, and <i>The Vertigo Years</i>, which has been made into a three-part television documentary.

Philipp Blom lives in Vienna."[An] eminently readable tome full of splendid anecdotal detail. Mr. Blom's ability to convey a mood and to synthesize complex issues, is admirable....

When Isaac English and Billy Poe--a pair of high-school friends straight out of Steinbeck--embark on a starry-eyed cross-country escape to California, a violent encounter with a trio of transients leaves one dead, prying the lid off a rusted can of failed hope and small-town secrets. <em>American Rust</em> is Philipp Meyer's first novel, and his taut, direct prose strikes the perfect tone for this kaleidoscope of fractured dreams, elevating a book that otherwise might be relentlessly dour to the level of honest and unflinching storytelling. (Interestingly, Meyer has a fan in Patricia Cornwell, who name-checked <em>American Rust</em> in her latest novel, <em>Scarpetta</em>, even though Meyer's book hadn't been released yet.) --<em>Jon Foro </em> <p></p> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: Philipp Meyer on <em>American Rust</em></strong><br><br> In the late seventies, when I was five, my parents moved us to a blue-collar neighborhood in Baltimore. As was the case with most of the old cities of the northeast, Baltimore was in the throes of a serious social collapse. Any industry you could name was falling apart--steel, ship-building, textiles--not to mention the docks and the port. The middle class was evaporating. Even among the neighborhood kids, there was a sense that things were getting worse, not better. <br><br> <p>That neighborhood was called Hampden, a place since immortalized in many of John Waters&#x2019;s films. Back then, even in Baltimore&#x2019;s often shoddy public schools, Hampden was not a place you wanted to admit you were from--my brother and I often lied when asked where we lived. There were police cars and ambulances on our street with some frequency, men passed out on the sidewalk. My father, a graduate student, once went outside with his pistol to check on a man whom he thought had been murdered near our house.</p> <p>Even so, there was a strong community and the people who were able did their best to watch out for each other. These were good people, working people, but in the end that didn&#x2019;t matter--their jobs had disappeared and they tumbled from the middle class into the ranks of what we now call the &#x201c;working poor.&#x201d; It was an early lesson into the way life worked for certain segments of our society.</p> <p>Many years later, after a long and roundabout route to get into and eventually graduate from college, I ended up taking a job on Wall Street. I was proud of my new job, proud I&#x2019;d gone from high school dropout to Cornell University graduate to Wall Street trader. Naturally, complications soon arose.</p> <p>One surprising thing was that while in most of the country the closing of a factory was seen as tragic, on Wall Street it was nearly a cause for celebration. Whatever the company in question, closing an American factory caused their stock price to go up. The more jobs were outsourced, the more the company executives made on their stock options, the more investment bankers racked up multi-million dollar bonuses. Meanwhile, a short distance away, thousands of families were being devastated.</p> <p>While I still have many close friends on Wall Street, after a few years there I knew it was the wrong path. I cared about people, I cared about their stories, I&#x2019;d stopped caring about money. After leaving the bank I spent my time writing and working jobs in construction and as an EMT; I moved back in with my parents and lived in their basement. In 2005, I lucked into a writing scholarship at the Michener Center for Writers in Austin, Texas, where I wrote the majority of <em>American Rust</em>.</p> <p>There are thousands of communities in which this book could have taken place, but Pittsburgh and the Monongahela Valley area, where I have many friends and family, seemed like the most natural setting. After thriving for a hundred years, helping to win our wars and build our great cities, the Mon Valley now offers a striking combination of rural beauty and industrial decay. Once the epitome of the American Dream--full of hard-working towns where you could make a name for yourself--the Valley today has the feel of a forgotten place.</p> <p>This was the backdrop of the story I wanted to tell in <em>American Rust</em>--how events beyond our control can change the way we define our humanity. I think Americans are a tough people, but often our best doesn&#x2019;t come out until we&#x2019;re pushed our hardest. This is what I set out to do in the book. I wanted to examine the old American themes of the individual versus society, freedom versus determinism. I wanted to investigate what really makes us human.</p>Philipp Meyer grew up in Baltimore, dropped out of high school and attended Cornell, where he studied English.

He lives in Long Island, New York.Sprightly, wry and irreverent, Sacred Origins of Profound Things attempts to explain the arcana of religious practice and dogma like prayer, celestial personae, moral codes, festivals, saints, evil, heaven, hell and miracles. Panati digs up fascinating curios while clearly explaining fundamental tenets of the world's religions. But his Religion 101 remains an awkward hybrid of brief journalistic entries (Panati is a former science writer at Newsweek) and short essays. Furthermore, not all "profound things" are covered equally or thoroughly. The religions of Asia are barely touched on, and aboriginal religions not at all. Of Judaism, Islam and Christianity, it is the last, and Catholicism in particular, that forms by far the largest part of the book. While readers looking for a quick answer will find useful the explanations of why religions affirm this or that belief, they will be frustrated by the lack of an index and the book's narrative rather than encyclopedic structure.

Humans and mutants and arcane races throng the gloom beneath its chimneys, where the rivers are sluggish with unnatural effluent, and factories and foundries pound into the night. For more than a thousand years, the parliament and its brutal militia have ruled over a vast array of workers and artists, spies, magicians, junkies and whores. Now a stranger has come, with a pocketful of gold and an impossible demand, and inadvertently something unthinkable is released. Soon the city is gripped by an alien terror - and the fate of millions depends on a clutch of outcasts on the run from lawmakers and crime-lords alike. The urban nightscape becomes a hunting ground as battles rage in the shadows of bizarre buildings. And a reckoning is due at the city&#39;s heart, in the vast edifice of Perdido Street Station. It is too late to escape. &#34;A work of exhaustive inventiveness ...superlative fantasy&#34;. (&#34;Time Out&#34;). &#34;A well-written, authentically engrossing adventure story, exuberantly full of hocus-pocus ...Mieville does not disappoint&#34;.

The novel's publication met with a burst of extravagant praise from Big Name Authors and was almost instantly a multiaward finalist. You expect hyperbole in blurbs; and sometimes unworthy books win awards, so nominations don't necessarily mean much. But <i>Perdido Street Station</i> deserves the acclaim. It's ambitious and brilliant and--rarity of rarities--sui generis. Its clearest influences are Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast trilogy and M. John Harrison's Viriconium books, but it isn't much like them. It's Dickensian in scope, but fast-paced and modern. It's a love song for cities, and it packs a world into its strange, sprawling, steam-punky city of New Crobuzon. It can be read with equal validity as fantasy, science fiction, horror, or slipstream. It's got love, loss, crime, sex, riots, mad scientists, drugs, art, corruption, demons, dreams, obsession, magic, aliens, subversion, torture, dirigibles, romantic outlaws, artificial intelligence, and dangerous cults. <p> Generous, gaudy, grand, grotesque, gigantic, grim, grimy, and glorious, <i>Perdito Street Station</i> is a bloody fascinating book. It's also so massive that you may begin to feel you're getting too much of a good thing; just slow down and enjoy.</p><p> Yes, but what is <i>Perdido Street Station</i> about? To oversimplify: the eccentric scientist Isaac Dan der Grimnebulin is hired to restore the power of flight to a cruelly de-winged birdman. Isaac's secret lover is Lin, an artist of the khepri, a humano-insectoid race; theirs is a forbidden relationship. Lin is hired (rather against her will) by a mysterious crime boss to capture his horrifying likeness in the unique khepri art form. Isaac's quest for flying things to study leads to verification of his controversial unified theory of the strange sciences of his world. It also brings him an odd, unknown grub stolen from a secret government experiment so perilous it is sold to a ruthless drug lord--the same crime boss who hired Lin. The grub emerges from its cocoon, becomes an extraordinarily dangerous monster, and escapes Isaac's lab to ravage New Crobuzon, even as his discovery becomes known to a hidden, powerful, and sinister intelligence. Lin disappears and Isaac finds himself pursued by the monster, the drug lord, the government and armies of New Crobuzon, and other, more bizarre factions, not all confined to his world. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p>towering bleached ribs of a dead, ancient beast lies New Crobuzon, a squalid city where humans, Re-mades, and arcane races live in perpetual fear of Parliament and its brutal militia.

A brawl in a Panton Saint brothel, a drunk, infatuated young Russian count, precede Lewrie's summons to Admiralty and the command of the Thermopylae frigate to replace an ill captain as the fleet gathers to face down the League of the North, and its instigator, the mad Tsar Paul.</p><p>Lewrie must take the Thermopylae into the Baltic in the dead of winter, alone and with no support, to scout the enemy fleets and iced-in harbors, deal with a fellow officer who is less of a friend than he thought, and be saddled with a pair of Russian noblemen as a last-minute peace delegation, but if the wily Foreign Office spy-master, Zachariah Twigg, sent them, what else might their mission be?</p><p>All that and the Battle of Copenhagen, too, and it's broadsides at close quarters, and treachery for Lewrie, forcing him to use all his wiles to survive! <i>The Baltic Gambit</i> is one of Dewey Lambdin's most enjoyable naval adventures yet.</p></p><p><p><b>Praise for author Dewey Lambdin:</b></p><p>"You could get addicted to this series.

For decades one of the most dangerous men in America, Bulger&#x2014;the brother of influential Massachusetts senator Billy Bulger&#x2014;was often romanticized as a Robin Hood-like thief and protector. While he was functioning as the de facto mob boss of New England, Bulger was also serving as a Top Echelon informant for the FBI, covertly feeding local prosecutors information about other mob figures&#x2014;while using their cover to cleverly eliminate his rivals, reinforce his own power, and protect himself from prosecution. Then, in 2011, he was arrested in southern California and returned to Boston, where he was tried and convicted of racketeering and murder.</p><p>Our greatest chronicler of the Irish mob in America, T. J. English covered the trial at close range&#x2014;by day in the courtroom, but also, on nights and weekends, interviewing Bulger&#x2019;s associates as well as lawyers, former federal agents, and even members of the jury in the backyards and barrooms of Whitey&#x2019;s world. In <em>Where the Bodies Were Buried,</em> he offers a startlingly revisionist account of Bulger&#x2019;s story&#x2014;and of the decades-long culture of collusion between the Feds and the Irish and Italian mob factions that have ruled New England since the 1970s, when a fateful deal left the FBI fatally compromised. English offers an authoritative look at Bulger&#x2019;s own understanding of his relationship with the FBI and his alleged immunity deal, and illuminates how gangsterism, politics, and law enforcement have continued to be intertwined in Boston.</p><p>As complex, harrowing, and human as a Scorsese film, <em>Where the Bodies Were Buried</em> is the last word on a reign of terror that many feared would never end.</p></p><p><p><em>New York Times</em> bestselling author T. J. English, the acclaimed master chronicler of the Irish Mob in America, offers a front-row seat at the trial of one of the most notorious gangsters of all&#x2014;Whitey Bulger&#x2014;and pulls back the veil to expose a breathtaking history of corruption and malfeasance</p><p>Whitey Bulger was, following the death of Osama bin Laden, the number-one fugitive on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list; he remained at large for sixteen years. One of the most prominent mobsters in Boston's criminal underworld from the 1970s until his disappearance in 1995, Bulger was sometimes romanticized as a Robin Hood&#x2013;esque thief and protector who looked out for his South Boston neighborhood.</p><p>But the truth was much more complicated&#x2014;and infinitely more sordid&#x2014;as his trial on racketeering charges revealed in alarming detail. Throughout the era in which Bulger was a crime boss, he was also a Top Echelon Informant (TE) for the FBI, supposedly helping prosecutors make organized-crime cases against the Mafia by feeding them information that could win them convictions in court. His relationship with the criminal justice system&#x2014;an arrangement he inherited from a previous generation of gangsters and corrupt lawmen&#x2014;represents the hidden horror of the Bulger story and the battleground on which prosecutors and defense lawyers clashed at his trial.</p><p>There have been other books on Bulger, but none like this. T. J. English&#x2014;author of <em>Paddy Whacked</em>, the definitive history of the Irish Mob&#x2014;was present every day of the proceedings, and in <em>Where the Bodies Were Buried</em> gives us not just an account of the trial but also a deeply sourced, disturbing portrait of the decades-long culture of collusion between the Feds and the Irish and Italian Mob factions that ruled Boston and much of New England from the 1970s forward. English provides the first look at Bulger's own understanding of his relationship with the FBI&#x2014;including the immunity deal he claimed with the U.S. Attorney's Office&#x2014;and an in-depth assessment of the degree to which gangsterism, politics, and law enforcement have long been intertwined in Boston.</p><p>Rich in first-person interviews with criminal associates, retired FBI agents, victims, and their families, <em>Where the Bodies Were Buried</em> completes the informal trilogy English began with <em>The Westies</em> and <em>Paddy Whacked</em> and promises to be the last word on a reign of terror that many feared would never end.</p><p>T.

This is the first time Pueblo historians have written about these events in book form; previous volumes reflected Spanish sources or more distant academic viewpoints. Drawing on their oral history and using their own words, the Pueblo writers discuss the history and importance of Po&#x2019;pay, the illustrious San Juan Pueblo Indian strategist and warrior who was renowned, respected and revered by their people as a visionary leader. Edited by Joe S. Sando (Jemez Pueblo) &amp; Herman Agoyo (San Juan Pueblo), this book includes contributions by Theodore S. Jojola (Isleta Pueblo), Robert Mirabal (Taos Pueblo), Alfonso Ortiz (San Juan Pueblo), Simon J. Ortiz (Acoma Pueblo), and Joseph H. Suina (Cochiti Pueblo)<p> <i>Po&#x2019;pay: Leader of the First American Revolution</i> also provides a comprehensive look at a particular time in New Mexico&#x2019;s history that changed the state forever, making it the richly multi-cultural "Land of Enchantment" that it is. Amplified with quotes from New Mexico and Pueblo leaders, the book also demonstrates how the events of the Pueblo Revolt enabled the Pueblos, unlike other American Indian groups, to continue their languages, traditions and religion on essentially the same lands from ancient times to today and how Po&#x2019;pay&#x2019;s legacy continues to inspire all people. The book also covers the historical making of the seven-foot-tall Tennessee marble statue, from the political processes involved to its actual creation, eventual completion and final dedication in the Statuary Hall on September 22, 2005.</p><p> Drawing on early Spanish records as well as the oral tradition preserved in the pueblos since the seventeenth century, Joe S. Sando tells the compelling story of the conditions of Spanish rule, the secret planning of Pueblo leaders and the remarkably coordinated Revolt that drove the Spanish from New Mexico in 1680. Under Po&#x2019;pay&#x2019;s leadership, the Revolt ended the persecutions and secured the future of the Pueblo People&#x2014;their culture, their land rights and their religious freedom. </p><p> Herman Agoyo brought history to life in the present as he guided the events leading to the completion of the Po&#x2019;pay statue. It was his vision and persistence that drove the project forward, through creating and passing in the New Mexico State Legislature the bill selecting Po&#x2019;pay, the fund-raising, and the final completion and dedication of the statue. This book is a celebration of New Mexico&#x2019;s culturally rich present as well as its history.</p></p><p><b>Joe S.

As a result, his narrative (the very book we are reading) turns into a literary "stew" an uproariously funny melange of journal entries, erotic poetry, parodies of all kinds, love letters, interviews, and lists--as Hugh Kenner in "Harper's" wrote, "for another such virtuoso of the List you'd have to resurrect Joyce." Soon, Lamont's characters (on loan from F. Scott Fitzgerald, Flann O'Brien, James Joyce, and Dashiell Hammet) take on lives of their own, completely sabotaging his narrative.

She&#x2019;s certain she hasn&#x2019;t seen the last of the infamous cat burglar Quinn. But she never expected him to turn up at her apartment one dark night in desperate need of her help&#x2014;help she can&#x2019;t refuse. The mysterious master thief is playing a dangerous game, and it&#x2019;s a game that just might get him killed.<br><br>With Morgan&#x2019;s help, Quinn sets a trap intended to catch someone far more elusive...and more deadly...than a thief. But an unseen threat shadows him in the fog-shrouded San Francisco night, an unknown adversary more cunning than any he has yet encountered. Now, just when the stakes are higher than even Quinn can imagine, no one can be trusted&#x2014;and everything&#x2019;s at risk.</p><p>Kay Hooper, who has more than six million copies of her books in print worldwide, has won numerous awards and high praise for her novels. Kay lives in North Carolina, where she is currently working on her next novel.<i>Chapter One</i><b><br></b><br><br>Morgan West was beginning to get tense about the entire situation. The Bannister collection of priceless artworks and gems would be moved to the museum within days, which meant the bait would be in the trap. Neither Max Bannister nor anyone else had deigned to inform her that there was a trap, information she knew only because of an overheard conversation. And she hadn't seen--or felt--a sign of Quinn in weeks.<br><br>It was maddening.<br><br>She didn't fool herself into believing that Quinn wasn't uppermost in her mind. Once she'd gotten over her fury at having been presented with a concubine ring (though she fully intended to give him a piece of her mind about that little item when next they met), she had gone back to spending an hour or two of her evenings parked outside some likely museum or jewelry store, hoping to be able to sense him, feel him, whatever the hell she'd been able to do before. But he hadn't been kidding when he'd said if he didn't want to be found, not even she would be able to find him.<br><br>The most elusive thief in the world seemed to have no difficulty in eluding her.<br><br>Dammit.<br><br>She had read the newspapers front to back and had kept her ears open during her days at the museum, but if Quinn had robbed anybody they apparently didn't know it. There had been no splashy headlines about the world-famous cat burglar, and no breathless news bulletins on television.<br><br>In fact, nobody had reported a jewel or art robbery of any kind since Max Bannister, his half brother Wolfe Nickerson, and Interpol agent Jared Chavalier had captured a psychotic thief bent on murdering Storm Tremaine, the exhibit's computer expert.<br><br>With that leader of an organized gang of thieves out of business and the gang scattered and inactive, anybody with valuables to protect in the city had heaved an almost audible sigh of relief.<br><br>In Morgan's own museum, the Mysteries Past exhibit space was nearly ready for the priceless collection of gems and artworks now being cleaned and appraised in its vault. And barring a definite undercurrent of tension between Wolfe and Jared, things had been downright peaceful.<br><br>Morgan told herself she should be happy about that state of affairs. It was best for all concerned. Quinn had quite probably gone back to Europe, especially after she'd warned him about the trap.<br><br>Something she hadn't mentioned to Max.<br><br>Still, in spite of common sense and logic, she had the nagging feeling that Quinn hadn't left San Francisco. He was here somewhere, and if he hadn't committed a robbery it was probably because he was waiting for a chance to grab Max's collection--trap or no trap.<br><br>That was why she kept looking for him, she told herself. Because if the first warning hadn't worked, maybe she could come up with one he would pay attention to. It was, after all, her responsibility to guard the forthcoming exhibit from harm, and Quinn undoubtedly posed a threat she should guard against.<br><br>Yeah, right! she sneered at herself.<br><br>She was an idiot, there was no doubt about it. She should be doing everything possible to put his ass behind bars and never mind warning him.<br><br>She could have provided the police with a very accurate description of him. Did he know that? Of course he did. Did he worry about it? No, because he knew all too well she wouldn't say a word to the police about being able to describe him.<br><br>Dammit.<br><br>She refused to wear the concubine ring--no matter how beautiful it was--but she hadn't exactly dumped it in the garbage either. In fact, she had a habit of taking it from her jewelry box and staring at it for long minutes each night before she went to bed.<br><br>And wouldn't Freud have a field day with that.<br><br>On this particular Thursday night, Morgan had, with difficulty, talked herself out of her usual search for Quinn. She had occupied herself with paperwork and a late movie, then showered and dressed for bed in her usual comfortable sleepshirt. She paid a brief visit to her jewelry box and studied the glowing, square stone of the concubine ring, said a few heartfelt words about Quinn's probable ancestry out loud, and, her feelings vented somewhat, went to bed.<br><br>When she woke with a start, the luminous display of her alarm clock proclaimed that it was twenty minutes after three in the morning. It was very quiet, but she found herself lying rigidly beneath the covers, wide awake, her ears straining. Something had awakened her, she knew that. Something--<br><br>There. A faint sound from the front of the apartment, from the living room. A scratching sound, then a very soft creak, the way a floorboard protested weight.<br><br>Morgan held very strong views about guns. She believed that the vast majority of the people who owned guns probably shouldn't have been trusted with a slingshot, and she believed that anyone who had both a gun and a child of any age in the same house was guilty of criminal stupidity.<br><br>But she had also been on her own for too long to take dumb chances. So she had learned to handle guns, from experts, and she had bought an automatic to keep in her apartment. Twice a month, she went to a target range and practiced scrupulously to keep her aim true. She was, in fact, a crack shot.<br><br>So it was almost a reflex to slide very carefully from the bed, ease open the drawer of her nightstand, and take out the gun. It was another reflex to thumb off the safety and hold the weapon in a practiced two-handed grip.<br><br>Of course, it probably would have been smarter to creep into the bathroom with the gun and her portable phone--also on the nightstand beside her bed--lock the door, and call the police. But she didn't even think of that until much later. Instead, she crept toward the door of her bedroom, ears straining, trying to be utterly silent.<br><br>The hallway was short, and she lingered close to the wall just outside the living room, searching the dark room for any sign of movement. There--by the window. It was only a shadow, indistinct, but it didn't belong there.<br><br>Remaining close to the wall for cover, her eyes fixed on the shadow, Morgan managed not to startle herself with the clear strength of her own voice. "I have a gun," she warned in a grim tone. "And I'll use it, believe me."<br><br>"I believe you." The voice was deep, masculine, and somewhat dry. "However . . . since American authorities haven't yet . . . put a price on my head . . . I'd rather you didn't. Shooting me for profit . . . makes perfect sense . . . to me . . . but I'm not . . . quite . . . ready for a mercy killing."<br><br>She slumped. "Quinn."<br><br>"Don't sound . . . so damned relieved, Morgana," he reproved in an even dryer voice. "I may not . . . be a murderous fiend, but you should . . . at the very least . . . consider me . . . dangerous. I am . . . a known felon . . . after all."<br><br>"You're a lunatic." Automatically, she pointed the pistol at the floor as she eased the hammer back down and thumbed on the safety. She stepped into the living room and put the gun on a table by the wall, then turned on the lamp there.<br><br>It took a moment for her eyes to adjust to the sudden light, but when they did she found him near the window, his gloved hands resting on her high-backed reading chair. More disappointed than she wanted to admit to herself, she noted that his usual all-black cat-burglar costume included the ski mask that effectively hid his face. Why was he hiding his face from her when she'd already seen it?<br><br>"What are you doing here, anyway?" she demanded.<br><br>"Happened . . . to be . . . in the neighborhood," he murmured.<br><br>Morgan took a step toward him, then another, frowning. He was standing too still, she thought, too stiffly. And something about the way he was speaking wasn't right. "Oh, really? And you just happened to climb up my fire escape and pick the lock on the window?"<br><br>"Lousy lock," he said, his voice growing softer, almost slurring. "You . . . ought to get another."<br><br>Forever afterward, Morgan was never certain at what moment she knew what had happened. But she began moving toward him more quickly, covering the space between them with hasty steps. Maybe it was pure instinct that told her what was wrong--the primal sensing of blood and weakness--but she knew with utter certainty that he was very badly hurt. As soon as she was closer to him, the fact was obvious.<br><br>"No police, Morgana," he muttered in that soft, thickened voice. "Doctors have to report . . . report--" He swayed, and she was barely able to reach him in time to keep his head from striking the floor when he fell.<br><br>A light breeze was clearing out the fog, but the night retained that swathed-in-cotton silence the mist usually provided, so she was careful to make no noise as she glided away from Morgan West's apartment building.<br><br>Interesting. Very interesting indeed.<br><br>And surprising. So the seemingly infallible Quinn had a weak spot? An unexpected vulnerability in the armor of his heart--and his brilliant mind?<br><br>She made her way to the car parked several blocks away and slid inside, only then allowing a soft laugh to escape her. She had come to San Francisco with one goal.<br><br>Now she had two.<br><br>"Quinn? Quinn?" The black of his sweater showed a dull, wet gleam high on his chest and on his left shoulder. A spreading gleam. And when she pulled the ski mask off, his lean, handsome face was ghostly pale and beaded with sweat, his flesh chilled. His eyes were closed.<br><br>Morgan had never felt so cold with fear, but first-aid training took over as she felt for the carotid pulse in his neck. His heart was beating, but faintly and the rhythm was all wrong; he was going into shock.<br><br>He was far too heavy for her to move. Keep him warm and elevate his legs, she told herself with a calm inner voice that came from God-knew-where. She dragged a heavy blanket from her bed and covered him, then lifted his legs carefully until they rested across a low hassock.<br><br>She didn't want to look at the wound but knew she had to, and Quinn's last mumbled words kept ringing hauntingly in her ears. She couldn't call a doctor, because doctors had to report violent wounds to the police, and the police wanted Quinn in the worst way.<br><br>Even so, Morgan knew with absolute certainty that Quinn alive and in jail would forever be her choice over Quinn dead and still an enigma to the police; if she had to make that decision, it was already made.<br><br>She used her sewing scissors and carefully cut his sweater open far enough to expose the wound. She didn't know much about this kind of thing, but she was certain she was looking at a bullet wound. One glance was enough; she made a thick pad of several clean cloths and pressed it gently over the sluggishly bleeding wound, fighting a queasy feeling. But that cool inner voice remained calm inside her head.<br><br>Not so bad. The bleeding's nearly stopped. Unless there's an exit wound . . . She slipped a hand under his shoulder and didn't know whether she should be relieved that the bullet was still lodged in his body. It isn't near the heart or lung. I think.<br><br>"Damn you," she muttered, hardly aware of speaking aloud. "Don't you die on me, Quinn. Damn you, don't die."<br><br>Those absurdly long lashes of his lifted and, even now, a gleam of amusement lurked in the darkened green eyes. "If you're going to swear at me," he said in a voice little more than a whisper, "then . . . at least use my first name."<br><br>"I don't know it," she snapped, holding on to her ferocity because she suspected it was the only thing that kept her from falling apart.<br><br>"Alex," he murmured with the ghost of a laugh.<br><br>Morgan didn't feel any sense of triumph at all, even though she was certain he wasn't lying to her. Alex was his name, his real name, and that knowledge put her several jumps ahead of just about everybody who was chasing Quinn. But she didn't feel any elation because he'd trusted her with the information. She was very much afraid that it might well be along the lines of a deathbed confession. Her voice held steady and grim.<br><br>"You die on me, Alex, and I'll hunt your ghost to the ends of the earth."<br><br>His eyes closed, but a faint chuckle escaped him. "I can save you . . . the search. You're quite . . . likely to find me . . . in the neighborhood . . . of perdition's flame . . . Morgana."<br><br>She tasted blood and realized she'd bitten her bottom lip. "I have to get a doctor for you--"<br><br>"No. The police. I can't . . . let them put me away . . . not now . . . I'm too close."<br><br>She didn't know what he was talking about. "Listen to me. You're in shock. You've lost a lot of blood. You have a bullet in you, and it has to come out." When his eyes opened again, she was even more alarmed by the feverish glitter stirring there. Quickly, she said, "Max. I'll call Max. He'll be able to get a doctor here quietly, without the police having to know."<br><br>It didn't strike her until much later how wonderfully ironic her solution was: a wounded cat burglar bleeding in her living room, and the only man who might be able to help him was the man who owned a priceless collection that would soon bait a trap designed to catch that cat burglar.<br><br>Ironic? It was insane.<br><br>Quinn looked at her for a long minute, and then a sigh escaped him. Relief, acceptance, regret, or something else--she wasn't sure what it was. But the smile that briefly curved his lips was a strange one, twisted with something other than pain.<br><br>"All right. Call him."<br><br>Despite the fact that it was the middle of the night, Max answered his private phone line in a clear, calm voice and listened to Morgan's hasty explanation without interruption. When she was through, he simply said, "I'm on my way," and she found herself listening to a dial tone.</p><h2>Fear of Flying</h2><p>Fictional Novel, Literary Fiction</p><p></p><h2>The Best American Magazine Writing 2013</h2><p>Chosen by the American Society of Magazine Editors, the stories in this anthology include National Magazine Award&#x2013;winning works of public interest, reporting, feature writing, and fiction.

As presidents, cabinet officers, and diplomats, slaveholding leaders controlled the main levers of foreign policy inside an increasingly powerful American state. <i>This Vast Southern Empire </i>explores the international vision and strategic operations of these southerners at the commanding heights of American politics.</p><p>For proslavery leaders like John C. Calhoun and Jefferson Davis, the nineteenth-century world was torn between two hostile forces: a rising movement against bondage, and an Atlantic plantation system that was larger and more productive than ever before. In this great struggle, southern statesmen saw the United States as slavery&#x2019;s most powerful champion. Overcoming traditional qualms about a strong central government, slaveholding leaders harnessed the power of the state to defend slavery abroad. During the antebellum years, they worked energetically to modernize the U.S. military, while steering American diplomacy to protect slavery in Brazil, Cuba, and the Republic of Texas.</p><p>As Matthew Karp demonstrates, these leaders were nationalists, not separatists. Their &#x201c;vast southern empire&#x201d; was not an independent South but the entire United States, and only the election of Abraham Lincoln broke their grip on national power. Fortified by years at the helm of U.S. foreign affairs, slaveholding elites formed their own Confederacy&#x2015;not only as a desperate effort to preserve their property but as a confident bid to shape the future of the Atlantic world.</p></p><p>Matthew Karp is Assistant Professor of History at Princeton University."Combining immense erudition with an engaging style, Karp sheds light on an important but poorly understood era in American foreign policy."&nbsp;--&nbsp;<b>Walter Russell Mead, <i>Foreign Affairs</i></b><br><br>"Southern politicians and pro-slavery ambitions shaped the foreign policy of the United States....

I found myself unmoored, unmated, ungrounded in a way that challenged everything I'd ever thought about human relationships. Situated squarely in that terrifying paradise called freedom, precipitously out on so many emotional limbs, it was as if I had been born; and in fact I was being reborn as the woman I was to become."<br><br>So says Pulitzer Prize-winning author Alice Walker about her beautiful new book, in which "one of the best American writers today" (The Washington Post) gives us superb stories based on rich truths from her own experience. Imbued with Walker's wise philosophy and understanding of people, the spirit, sex and love, The Way Forward Is with a Broken Heart begins with a lyrical, autobiographical story of a marriage set in the violent and volatile Deep South during the early years of the civil rights movement. Walker goes on to imagine stories that grew out of the life following that marriage&#x2014;a life, she writes, that was "marked by deep sea-changes and transitions." These provocative stories showcase Walker's hard-won knowledge of love of many kinds and of the relationships that shape our lives, as well as her infectious sense of humor and joy. Filled with wonder at the power of the life force and of the capacity of human beings to move through love and loss and healing to love again, The Way Forward Is with a Broken Heart is an enriching, passionate book by "a lavishly gifted writer" (The New York Times Book Review).</p><p>Even a fickle reader of Alice Walker will find something to admire in <i>The Way Forward Is with a Broken Heart</i>. This tender, elegiac collection of stories is based in part on her early marriage to a white man and her continuing puzzlement at how their connection--once so charmed and resilient--faded to nothing. Looking back at their happy years together in "the racially volatile and violent Deep South state of Mississippi," a place and time in which their union was not only unconventional but illegal, Walker is also led to imagine other, less metaphoric homecomings. After the initial autobiographical story, "To My Young Husband," she turns to a character named Rosa, a novelist like herself, who returns home to the South with her sister, Barbara, after their grandfather's death. Rosa had not made it to the funeral, since news of his death arrived just as she was leaving on a long-planned holiday abroad. Now, belatedly, she has come to gather family stories. But when she asks her Aunt Lily a question, this woman glares back at her with something close to hatred: "I don't want to find myself in anything you write. And you can just leave your daddy alone too." Reeling, Rosa turns to her sister for comfort, but Barbara, too, rejects her with "a look that said she'd got the reply she'd deserved." <blockquote>For wasn't she always snooping about the family's business and turning things about in her writing in ways that made the family shudder? There was no talking to her as you talked to regular people. The minute you opened your mouth a meter went on. Rose could read all this on her sister's face. She didn't need to speak. And it was a lonely feeling that she had. For Barbara was right. Aunt Lily too. And she could no more stop the meter running than she could stop her breath. </blockquote> With her characteristic insight and her slow, colloquial prose--seeded with anger but watered with hope--Walker explores the territory of her own broken heart and those of African Americans of her generation. <i>--Regina Marler</i>"Places Walker in the company of Faulkner."<br>--The Nation, about The Color Purple<br><br>"Superb...a work to stand beside literature of any time and place."<br>--San Francisco Chronicle, about The Color Purple<br><br>"Just when you think Alice Walker has empathized her way as far as any writer can go, she goes further....Each essay is a gift."<br>--Gloria Steinem, about Anything We Love Can Be Saved<br><br>"[Alice Walker] is exceptionally brave: She takes on subjects at which most writers would flinch and quail, and probably fail.

Yet the visionary inventor Muybridge was also a murderer who killed coolly and meticulously, and his trial became a national sensation. Despite Muybridge&#x2019;s crime, the artist&#x2019;s patron, railroad tycoon Leland Stanford, founder of Stanford University, hired the photographer to answer the question of whether the four hooves of a running horse ever left the ground all at once&#x2014;and together these two unlikely men launched the age of visual media.

I walked up the face of Nob Hill to look at the place where it used to stand. Could there be a tiny remnant of this temple of money? The hill had been known as California Hill until Leland Stanford and family moved there in 1876, followed by their preposterously rich friends. After that it was Nob Hill. Stanford and the other nabobs (a word borrowed from Mughal India, trimmed in America to &#x201c;nobs&#x201d;) built houses that showed their money and looked with a possessive gaze at the city below. The day after the earthquake the fire came, on a Thursday morning in April, and the two disasters took down all the big houses but one.<br><br>At the top of Nob Hill today are apartment buildings, hotels, a little park. The place that survived, the last sign of the sovereigns who had set themselves up on these blocks, was the Flood house. James Flood, a mining multimillionaire, was one of the men who exploited the Comstock Lode, a thick vein of silver in Nevada that ended up in most coins. The fire had somehow wrapped around and missed his house. When the silver man died, the Flood mansion went into the hands of the Pacific-Union Club, which seems fitting&#x2014;a men&#x2019;s club whose members dote on money, the way the nabobs did. I looked at the Flood house, a megalith in brown stucco, and imagined it in its original setting, amid a colony of American palaces. The first and most ostentatious of them, the Stanford house, used to stand a block to the east, at California and Powell Streets. An eight-story hotel now occupied that site, planted over the ruins. Only the granite wall that used to frame the house remained.<br><br>Mark Twain&#x2019;s novel The Gilded Age gave its name to the late nineteenth century, a time of monopoly with its high tide of corruption and greed. Nob Hill was one of the age&#x2019;s capitals, and whatever went on here took shape in a Brobdingnagian scale. But one episode of those years, as far as I can see, has been overlooked. It could be said that the world of visual media got under way on this hill, amid the new money of California, in the late 1800s. It happened one night at a party, at which the entertainment was a photographer called Edward Muybridge.<br><br>January 16, 1880<br><br>California and Powell Streets, San Francisco<br><br>It was the night pictures began to move. Just what it was that happened that night could not be accurately described for many years. It would not be comprehensible until the movie theaters had spread and the television stations were built, or maybe even until screens appeared in most rooms and people carried them in their hands. That winter night in San Francisco pictures jumped into motion, someone captured time and played it back. A newspaperman noticed that something unusual had happened, although he did not say anything about time. He noticed only that whatever it was that happened had taken place in the home of the best-known citizen of the state of California; he noticed these facts but missed the main event. The newspaperman pointed out that a photographer of angular shape named Edward Muybridge and his new machine had been the reason for the gathering, but he did not describe what Muybridge had done. Thanks to the paper (and notwithstanding the reporter&#x2019;s oversights), we know who was there, in the house. We know who came around to the stupendous mansion where Muybridge assembled his mechanism and put it in motion and carried it through its initial performance.<br><br>The event with the photographer took place in the home of an abnormally rich family. It was the end of the week. The family stayed in for the evening and invited some friends for a party and a show.<br><br>Their brown, stuccoed palazzo occupied the best site on California Hill, looking out to the flickering lights on San Francisco Bay and down at the streets of the rolling city. From a block away&#x2014;and you had to get that far back to see the whole thing&#x2014;the house looked to be a chunky, dark mass, Italianate in style. The owners of the house wanted it to exceed, if possible, the pomp of the European palaces, and to achieve this they had hired the New York design firm Pottier &amp; Stymus, which had a record of extravagance, to ornament every square yard of its interior. When the decorators were finished, the place had a magnitude and pretense that no one in California had previously seen. Without rival, it was the most talked-up house west of the Mississippi.<br><br>The Stanford family lived here, just three people, a mother and father and their eleven-year-old son. The Stanfords employed about twelve servants, half of whom lived in the brown house and some of whom traveled with the family to serve them at their horse farm south of the city. Newspapers were soaked with ink about the Stanfords&#x2019; outsized lives. The San Francisco Daily Call labeled tonight&#x2019;s event &#x201c;The Stanford Entertainment,&#x201d; and from those three words everyone knew where and for whom the photographer Edward Muybridge was doing whatever it was he did with his picture machine.<br><br>This year he was Edward Muybridge, but the spelling of his name would soon change, as it had done on four previous occasions. Every few years, the photographer would move a vowel or switch a couple of consonants. He used to be Edward Muygridge, and before that, Edward Muggeridge. For a few years he used the professional name &#x201c;Helios,&#x201d; the single moniker of an artist, borrowed in this case from the Greek god of the sun.<br><br>Along with his name, his working life had already passed through several metamorphoses. During his twenties Muybridge had been a book and print salesman for a London publisher; he sold dictionaries and encyclopedias and art books, engravings, and lithographs. In his thirties he tried to make a living as an inventor but failed when buyers showed indifference to his patents. After that, he put on the top hat of a capitalist: he started a mining company, and then an investment firm. Both ended badly. At age thirty-seven, he invented himself for the last time, as an artist: he became a photographer. He had followed a wandering path and only came to a single road as a middle-aged man. The choice of photography, at last, seemed to him to vindicate all the disappointments and failures that had gone before.<br><br>Edward Muybridge wore a beard down to the middle of his chest, a gray weave with a dark residue. Occasionally he might have combed it. The hair on his head was white, swirling at the ears, tossed up from his brow. His eyes were sharp blue. The crinkly beard and flowing hair made him look antique, wizardlike. One newspaper said that Muybridge looked &#x201c;at least ten years older&#x201d; than his natural age, which was forty-nine: a man in midlife wearing a mask of seniority.<br><br>After twelve years with the camera, he was the best-known photographer in San Francisco. Part of his renown came from his pictures, notably the ones he had taken in Yosemite Valley. The naturalist John Muir had explored and written about the seven-mile-long chasm in upper California, an extravagance of cliffs and depths and vistas. A photographer called Carleton Watkins had been one of the first to descend into Yosemite&#x2019;s hollows and come back with pictures. But Muybridge&#x2019;s photographs of the valley&#x2019;s flagrant rock faces and bridal-veil waterfalls had exceeded those of Watkins and helped to make Yosemite a part of national lore. The landscape of Yosemite, its wildness and excess, which Muybridge framed and made mythic, had come to represent the West to people in the eastern states.<br><br>Yosemite was part of Muybridge, but other parts of him were urban. Three years earlier he had made a panorama of San Francisco in photographs, the city in 360 degrees. To shoot it he had stood on the turret of the Mark Hopkins house, another mansion farther up the hill from the Stanford place. Muybridge had cranked the camera around on his tripod, measuring and panning, foot by foot, until the whole city went under the lens. He had given Leland Stanford and his wife, Jane, the biggest version of the panorama, an unrolling carpet of a picture, seventeen feet long and two feet high&#x2014;an expensive thank-you gift for years of assignments and friendship.<br><br>The photographer who tramped the wilderness and scaled city summits had a thin, vigorous body. The same witness who called him &#x201c;old&#x201d; also wrote that Muybridge possessed the jauntiness of a twenty-five-year-old man. People knew his athleticism. He was the man who skipped down flights of stairs, the agile camera operator most conspicuous around San Francisco, a blur seen in continual movement from the Golden Gate to San Jose. The tripod went up&#x2014;it must be Muybridge again&#x2014;and it came down.<br><br>Edward Muybridge had another stroke of renown, outside of his work, which was the fame of his crime. Wherever he went, it followed the photographer. He was a murderer, and the aura of his violence lingered, stirring an atmosphere as palpable as his acclaim as an artist. Muybridge&#x2019;s crime had been reported throughout the United States, so strange were its details, so fascinating was its passion to so many people. The photographer had a reasonable claim to be the one citizen who pulled behind him the largest cloud of dark gossip in the state of California. Of course he pretended as though the talk about him did not buzz incessantly, that he was merely a member of San Francisco&#x2019;s small, vivid cultural establishment. Perhaps he had no other choice but to pretend. Certainly this pose worked more to his advantage than fully inhabiting the role of a killer.<br><br>Tonight Muybridge stood at a table in the middle of a giant room. In the Stanford mansion, the rooms had names. This one, in all probability, was the Pompeian Room, the showiest room, which the family used to entertain. About forty feet square, it had four walls of murals that replicated frescoes found in houses uncovered beneath the volcanic dirt at Pompeii. The Stanfords had paid Pottier &amp; Stymus, the decorators, to create a showplace of replica history in their house. In the Pompeian Room they had placed gilded chairs and marble-topped tables with slender legs to make a pastiche of ancient Rome, and life-size marble nymphs to stand guard.<br><br>If not here, Muybridge may have stood in the Music and Art Room, a gallery twenty yards long whose wine-red walls were hung with fifty-some landscapes and portraits, and whose ceiling was painted with medallions depicting the faces of Rubens, Van Dyck, Beethoven, Mozart, Raphael, and Michelangelo. &#x201c;Few palaces of Europe excel this house,&#x201d; said one newswriter, who may not have been to Europe but who knew the fantasies of Americans who looked up to the Old World.<br><br>Or he could have been in one of the other downstairs parlors, or in the library, the ballroom, or the aviary. Huge mantelpieces and elaborate rosewood fittings dominated each of them, and a grove of furnishing spread to the edges in leather, silk, brocade, or velvet. Wherever Muybridge was, he had to clear away the crush of decor and work around chandeliers heavy as cannon that dangled just above the head, because he needed a straight thirty feet for what he had to accomplish. Muybridge made pictures that were very different from the imagery that decorated the walls, ceilings, and floors of the Stanford mansion. His pictures were not massive, like most of the fixtures, and they were not imitations of art found in Europe. They were evanescent and thin, they were pictures flung on air.<br><br>A scattering of guests arrived in twos and threes, with buttons on bulges, lace on bosoms. Some were politicians, like the newly elected governor of California, George Perkins, and Reuben Fenton, U.S. senator from New York and former governor. Behind the lawmakers came a phalanx of rich people, a few of them as rich as their hosts, the Stanfords. In this group were the neighbors, Charles Crocker and his wife, Mary Ann Deming, who lived two blocks away in a brown house only a little less grand than the Stanfords&#x2019; palazzo. There was also a young woman, Jennie Flood, an heiress in the new California manner. She came with her father, James Flood, a silver miner who had gotten rich on specie metal from Nevada and built a supreme and impressive house around the corner, at California and Mason Streets. Lesser elites and their spouses filled out the invitation list&#x2014;a judge here, a doctor there.<br><br>Servants brought in drink, gaslight drank the air. The woman of the house, Mrs. Jane Stanford, presented herself, tall, ample, and bejeweled. Jane Stanford cultivated a gothic look. She liked to drape herself in crimson velvet, with pools of hem and long trains behind, old lace circling her neck. She was sure to be wearing an arm&#x2019;s length of opals or a parure of diamonds consisting of necklace, bracelets, and earrings.<br><br>The night promised a pageant of some kind, but two men already radiated something of the theater. Leland Stanford and Edward Muybridge were the best-known men at the party&#x2014;Stanford for his money, Muybridge for his pictures (as well as the other thing), and together they inspired most of the hushed chatter. They had known each other for almost ten years and had spent a lot of that time talking and wondering about a single subject: the gait of horses. A narrow topic, yes, but one on the mind of many in the year 1880. Everyone knew that Stanford was horse-mad, and that he and Muybridge had formed a bond over horses. It was Stanford&#x2019;s belief that during a gallop, horses at some point in their stride lift all four hooves off the ground, that in effect, they become airborne. No one knew, really&#x2014;the legs of a horse moved too fast to tell with the eye. Stanford had asked Muybridge to solve his problem, to prove or disprove his hypothesis, which horse people referred to as the theory of &#x201c;unsupported transit.&#x201d;<br><br>Some of the talk that Stanford aroused would not have flattered him. At least some of the guests at the party, perhaps the politicians and the more middle-class group, inevitably regarded their hosts with ambivalence&#x2014;envy would not be too strong a word, and maybe a touch of fear. Almost twenty years before, Leland Stanford and several others had founded the Central Pacific Railroad, with Stanford in the role of company president. The firm, using big government subsidies, and the sweat of perhaps twenty thousand Chinese immigrants, had built the western half of the transcontinental line, the 850-mile track over the Sierra Mountains that linked California to the eastern states. In the early years of the Central Pacific, Stanford had been an object of fealty. Newspaper accounts painted him as a great benefactor of California: he brought work and wealth and even glory to the West, his admirers said, justifying the stage name of California, the Golden State.</p><h2>The Esoteric Secrets of Surrealism: Origins, Magic, and Secret Societies</h2><p>A profound understanding of the surrealists&#x2019; connections with alchemists and secret societies and the hermetic aspirations revealed in their works <br> <br>� Explains how surrealist paintings and poems employed mythology, gnostic principles, tarot, voodoo, alchemy, and other hermetic sciences to seek out unexplored regions of the mind and recover lost &#x201c;psychic&#x201d; and magical powers <br> <br>� Provides many examples of esoteric influence in surrealism, such as how Picasso&#x2019;s <i>Demoiselles d&#x2019;Avignon</i> was originally titled <i>The Bath of the Philosophers</i> <br> <br>Not merely an artistic or literary movement as many believe, the surrealists rejected the labels of artist and author bestowed upon them by outsiders, accepting instead the titles of magician, alchemist, or--in the case of Leonora Carrington and Remedios Varo--witch. Their paintings, poems, and other works were created to seek out unexplored regions of the mind and recover lost &#x201c;psychic&#x201d; and magical powers. They used creative expression as the vehicle to attain what Andr� Breton called the &#x201c;supreme point,&#x201d; the point at which all opposites cease to be perceived as contradictions. This supreme point is found at the heart of all esoteric doctrines, including the Great Work of alchemy, and enables communication with higher states of being. <br> <br>Drawing on an extensive range of writings by the surrealists and those in their circle of influence, Patrick Lepetit shows how the surrealists employed mythology, gnostic principles, tarot, voodoo, and alchemy not simply as reference points but as significant elements of their ongoing investigations into the fundamental nature of consciousness. He provides many specific examples of esoteric influence among the surrealists, such as how Picasso&#x2019;s famous <i>Demoiselles d&#x2019;Avignon</i> was originally titled <i>The Bath of the Philosophers</i>, how painter Victor Brauner drew from his father&#x2019;s spiritualist vocation as well as the Kabbalah and tarot, and how doctor and surrealist author Pierre Mabille was a Freemason focused on finding initiatory paths where &#x201c;it is possible to feel a new system connecting man with the universe.&#x201d; <br> <br>Lepetit casts new light on the connection between key figures of the movement and the circle of adepts gathered around Fulcanelli. He also explores the relationship between surrealists and Freemasonry, Martinists, and the Elect Cohen as well as the Grail mythos and the Arthurian brotherhood.</p><p>Patrick Lepetit has written several books in French on esoteric traditions and surrealism.

Walls have protected us and divided us, but have they also affected the way we think, work, and create?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a brisk and compulsively readable narrative of invasions, empires, kings, and khans, David Frye presents a bold new theory: walls haven't just influenced the course of history; they have profoundly shaped the human psyche.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For thousands of years, people have built walls and assaulted them, admired walls and reviled them. Great walls have appeared on every continent, the handiwork of Persians, Romans, Chinese, Inca, Ukrainians, and dozens of other peoples. They have accompanied the rise of cities, nations, and empires. And yet they rarely appear in our history books.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <i>Walls</i>, David Frye makes a powerful case for rewriting history. Drawing on evidence from around the world, as well as his own experiences on archaeological digs, Frye takes us on a provocative and occasionally humorous journey across windswept deserts and grassy, Northumbrian hills. As Frye guides us through a maze of exotic locales, investigating the coldest of cold cases, he gradually exposes a broader story with implications for the present as well as the past. The history of walls becomes more than a tale of bricks and stone; it becomes the story of who we are and how we came to be.<b></b><b></b><b></b></p><p>David Frye is a professional historian, whose views have been sought in interviews by the Science Channel, CNBC, National Geographic, the History Channel, BBC Radio, The Washington Post, Rolling Stone, Wired, and many other media outlets.&nbsp; A specialist in late ancient history, Frye received his PhD from Duke University and has participated in several archaeological excavations internationally.&nbsp; His articles have appeared in a variety of academic journals, popular websites, magazines, and blogs, including McSweeney's, Time, BBC World History, Medium, and MHQ.Walls Midwife to Civilization: Wall Builders at the Dawn of History<p></p> THE ANCIENT NEAR EAST, 2500&#x2013;500 BC<p></p> <br>The great wall of Shulgi has not survived, but then, how could it? Time lay heavily across the landscape of Mesopotamia. Like some relentlessly pressing weight, it sought to smother everything that would rise up out of the flat alluvial plains of ancient Iraq. Its effects there were uncharacteristically swift, almost impatient; it destroyed things before it could age them. As early as the third millennium BC, the Mesopotamians already had a word&#x2014;dul&#x2014;for the shapeless lumps of dead cities that even then dotted the horizons, having long ago melted like wax under the sun. Dul eventually gave way to an Arabic word, tell, which reflected the growing obscurity shrouding the region&#x2019;s past. To the Bedouins whose animals meandered around the unsightly mounds, the tells were nothing more than insignificant heaps of dirt. Only later did archaeologists realize that every one of those strange landmarks represented the ruins of a lost world.<br> <br>In Shulgi&#x2019;s day, some four thousand years ago, Mesopotamians battled ceaselessly against the work of time. They lived as if in sand castles, forever building and rebuilding a world that would inevitably be washed away. Nothing endured. The great fertile fields that fed the cities were a mirage. If the workers neglected the cleaning and repair of their vast irrigation systems for even a few seasons, the ditches would silt up, and the land would return to desert. Their buildings were no more permanent. For construction materials, the Mesopotamians had little more than the dirt beneath their feet. In this hot land made of silt deposited by the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, there were no stones and few trees. Lacking sufficient fuel to bake all their mud bricks, the Mesopotamians settled for drying them in the sun, a process that created building blocks of such dubious quality that they could not withstand even occasional rain. To protect their brick walls, the Mesopotamians slathered them with a plaster of mud, and when that first outer coat washed away, they slathered them with mud again. If they were diligent at maintaining their walls, the resulting accumulation of washed-off plaster would eventually clog the streets, forcing them to knock down the buildings and start over. If they were interrupted in their maintenance, the result was much the same as for the unirrigated fields: temples, palaces, and even city walls crumbled away. Another city became a tell.<br> <br>The impermanence of their mud-built world clearly troubled the Mesopotamians. A popular legend&#x2014;possibly the most popular, judging from the variety of copies that have survived&#x2014;tells of a king who refused to accept that he, like all mortals, must someday die and return to clay. The mythical Gilgamesh searched far and wide for a way to cheat death, but his efforts went for nothing. The Mesopotamian storytellers couldn&#x2019;t conceive of any ending for their hero that didn&#x2019;t require him to sink back into the soil.<br> <br>In the end, the Mesopotamians defeated time in only one activity. The clay tablets upon which they inscribed their cuneiform writing have survived the passing centuries completely unchanged. If the planet endures another million years, those tablets will also endure, remaining in exactly the same condition.<br> <br>Successful, therefore, in overcoming time only in their record keeping, the Mesopotamians naturally developed the bureaucratic urge to assign dates to events, and this led to the habit of kings giving names to years. Though perhaps not so elegant a system of chronology as our current one, it did serve a second purpose that has become quite useful to historians. It allowed the kings to commemorate their achievements&#x2014;including the building of structures that they surely realized could not last.<br> <br>Shulgi&#x2014;who, as king of Ur around 2000 BC, ruled over much of Mesopotamia&#x2014;was a builder of many things that didn&#x2019;t last, and he was a few other things besides. It&#x2019;s probably best to let his own words speak for him. The long-reigning monarch composed several extant hymns of self-praise, and these tell us a great deal about him, if we can shake the nagging suspicion that he has padded his r�sum� somewhat. Shulgi clearly wrestled with the constraints of modesty. In one hymn, he described himself as &#x201c;a powerful man who enjoys using his thighs.&#x201d; This was the sort of boast that probably shouldn&#x2019;t have been committed to a medium that could still be read after four thousand years. Then again, Shulgi also referred to himself as the &#x201c;god of manliness,&#x201d; so it would seem he wasn&#x2019;t easily embarrassed. He assures us that, as a youth, he excelled all other students. Grown to manhood, he slew every lion in Mesopotamia and defeated every human enemy as well. He mastered all weapons and musical instruments, and in a rare feat of athleticism, he once delighted his cheering subjects by running over two hundred miles in a single day. These, at least, are Shulgi&#x2019;s claims, whether or not we choose to accept them. He was no stranger to boasting, and so it should come as no surprise that his year names comprise a rather predictable list of triumphs.<br> <br>In the twentieth year of his kingship&#x2014;&#x201c;The Year the Citizens of Ur Were Drafted as Spearmen&#x201d;&#x2014;Shulgi apparently instituted a general draft, and this led to a particularly impressive series of victories. From that time forward, the bombastic monarch had Ur&#x2019;s enemies on the run. The region was experiencing its great revival, duly reflected in the names of years, and the triumphal march seemed poised to continue indefinitely.<br> <br>However, Shulgi&#x2019;s year list reveals a conspicuous absence of military successes immediately after his defeat of Anshan in the thirty-fourth year of his reign. Three years later, after what might have been merely a brief pause in the litany of conquests, we sense for the first time that something has gone terribly wrong. In his thirty-seventh year, Shulgi failed to record a victory yet again. For a notable achievement, he could highlight only a different sort of enterprise, one that seems oddly uncharacteristic, at least for someone with such splendid and busy thighs. It was the sort of achievement that would soon enough crumble and be washed away, returned to the soil and smothered by time. Shulgi&#x2019;s thirty-seventh year was officially designated &#x201c;The Year the Wall of the Land Was Built.&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>* * *<br> <br>In retrospect, Shulgi&#x2019;s decision to build a wall was no great innovation. For a people such as the Mesopotamians, who were accustomed to the constant chore of construction and reconstruction, the first solution to any problem was building. They built temples to fend off the wrath of their gods and walls to fend off the wrath of their enemies. They built canals, dams, and irrigation channels so they could live.<br> <br>Like early farming communities everywhere, cities in Mesopotamia focused their greatest efforts on surrounding themselves with fortifications. Massive bulwarks protected the people, their food supplies, their wealth, and their animals. Walls engulfed all man-made structures, swallowing up ziggurats and cities with equal appetite. Uruk, the city of Gilgamesh, was defined by its &#x201c;all-encircling wall,&#x201d; allegedly built by the great king himself. This may well have been an instance of art imitating life. Nearly every Mesopotamian king advertised having raised up at least one city wall, and many built more than one. They knew their works wouldn&#x2019;t last for any great period, but the prospect of repeating the labors of their ancestors didn&#x2019;t deter them. At least five different kings provided walls for Babylon, and at least four built walls for Ur. An individual born in Isin at the right time could have seen his city surrounded by three successive sets of walls&#x2014;sand castles every one.<br> <br>For the Mesopotamians, building was a sacred duty. On the first day of a new construction project, the king blessed a brick mold, then packed it with mud. Songs and the beating of kettledrums filled the air. The king brushed a brick stamp with honey, butter, and cream, then struck his mark on the wet clay. When the brick dried, the king himself ceremoniously lifted it out of the mold. Subsequently, the moment might be memorialized in a year name or even in art. Many of the greatest Mesopotamian kings&#x2014;including Shulgi&#x2014;were depicted in their official propaganda carrying baskets of bricks on their heads.<br> <br>The drudgery required by all these enterprises must have been awful, but the Mesopotamians accepted it as their lot. An ancient Mesopotamian flood myth describes how the gods set out to dig the first irrigation ditches and wells. The work didn&#x2019;t suit them. First, they complained; then they burned their tools and baskets. Finally, they created mankind to take over their chores. Someone had to move all that mud.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Not every Mesopotamian enjoyed a good wall raising. The words of a Bronze Age shepherd have come down to us, describing his feelings about life behind walls. Shepherds were the freest members of Near Eastern society. They inhabited Mesopotamia in great numbers, but unlike farmers they spent long periods far away from the city, accompanying their flocks to pasture. For much of the year&#x2014;especially when crops were growing&#x2014;shepherds had to steer clear of all sown land, and the obsessively bureaucratic administrators of the palaces and temples for whom the shepherds worked hardly kept track of them at all. To individuals such as these, the limited horizon of the walled city was worse even than a cage. &#x201c;If I leave myself inside just one day,&#x201d; our Bronze Age herdsman remarked, &#x201c;until I leave the city walls to renew my vigor, my vitality ebbs away.&#x201d;<br> <br>It&#x2019;s worthwhile taking a closer look at those particular Mesopotamians who had so little use for walls. They weren&#x2019;t the most refined inhabitants of the plains. For the most part, the shepherds were illiterate, known to us only by the scribblings of city dwellers. The two groups were connected by kinship but little else. In the eyes of the townsfolk, the shepherds were quite distinct, a rough and somewhat fearless lot, skilled with slings, throw sticks, and staffs, inured to loneliness, dark, and the hazards of outdoor living. The daily life of the shepherd contrasted sharply with that of the farmer or factory worker. Shepherds contended with fierce sheep-stealing carnivores, whereas farmers merely fended off placid, skittish herbivores. Like the biblical David of 1 Samuel 17:34&#x2013;36, shepherds lived with weapons, killing, and the mortal dangers of the steppe:<br> <br>Your servant used to keep sheep for his father; and whenever a lion or bear came, and took a lamb from the flock, I went after it and struck it down, rescuing the lamb from its mouth; and if it turned against me, I would catch it by the jaw, strike it down, and kill it. Your servant has killed both lions and bears; and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be like one of them.<br> <br>In contrast to the people who dwelled behind walls, shepherds accepted little in the way of governance. Even those herders directly employed by the temple or palace had to report to their overseers only twice a year. For them, the temptation to drift away must have been strong. The authors of Genesis, writing in the first millennium BC, certainly saw nothing extraordinary about the idea that shepherds might head off with their flocks and never return. In biblical tradition, Abraham, a possessor of flocks, herds, and tents, simply abandons his original home in the Mesopotamian city of Ur and sets off with his animals and women and over three hundred fighting men. Abraham&#x2019;s band subsequently wanders about, living wherever they pitch their tents, and forcing the urban kings of Canaan and the Jordan Valley to acquiesce to their presence on the land. They help themselves to water from city wells or, less frequently, dig new wells, which become such flash points for violence that they&#x2019;re given names such as Contention and Enmity. They negotiate for women and occasionally slaughter whole cities for them. A generation removed from Abraham, his herding descendants are remembered mostly for their hotheadedness. Jacob, lying on his deathbed, fondly describes his sons: Simeon and Levi are angry, violent, and quick to sword. Judah&#x2019;s hands are on the neck of his enemies. Gad is a raider, Benjamin a ravenous wolf, and so forth.<br> <br>In Mesopotamian myth, the goddess Inanna is asked to choose between a farmer and a shepherd, both of whom seek to marry her. In her deliberations, she rudely criticizes the herder. He is too brash and his clothes are coarse. Without the gods of civilization, she declares, the shepherd would live roofless in the steppes, a mere nomad. It&#x2019;s a rather harsh assessment, but in the end, she marries him anyway. Apparently, she prefers a bad boy.<br> <br>Inanna&#x2019;s decision&#x2014;the sort that has baffled countless generations of &#x201c;nice guys&#x201d; left alone on a Friday night&#x2014;would have raised few eyebrows in Shulgi&#x2019;s day. Shepherds were widely admired in the ancient Near East. They occupied a place in the imagination much like the cowboys of the Old West. &#x201c;I am a hero!&#x201d; a king such as Shulgi would boast. &#x201c;I am a shepherd!&#x201d; But, of course, Shulgi was no such thing, and neither were any of those other Sumerian kings who carried baskets of mud bricks on their heads. The shepherds, who disdained walls, were rootless, rough, unpredictable, and often violent. They were the sort of men who could defend a city&#x2014;and they were often asked to do so&#x2014;but they could never build one. On the other hand, nothing in the description of the shepherd applies particularly well to their cousins who raised a civilization out of mud. Mesopotamian townspeople were as monotonously reliable as they were settled. In the city, survival depended on the unwavering commitment of citizens to their wearisome chores&#x2014;the digging of wells, the constant removal of silt from the irrigation ditches, and the building and rebuilding of walls. They enlivened the tedium of this work with music and festivals and prostitution, but these diversions did not compromise their efficiency.<br> <br>The townspeople&#x2019;s acceptance of a life of labor&#x2014;replete with governors, supervisors, rules, and records&#x2014;had innumerable implications for Mesopotamian society. The most obvious was that it rendered men less capable as protectors. Workers, bound by their day-to-day responsibilities, couldn&#x2019;t go off on hunts that might have honed their fighting skills. Ensconced behind their walls, they became accustomed to a life of comfort and security. They exhausted their energies in labor rather than saving it for bursts of violence. Those few townsmen who were forced into battle fought like men unaccustomed to war, being perhaps the first soldiers anywhere to protect themselves by donning rudimentary armor that fortified the spirit more than the body. Like the timid amateurs that they were, they fought in tightly packed rows of infantry. Slow moving, inflexible, and easily targeted or pursued, these early phalanxes embodied a natural tendency to seek safety in numbers and for the weak to crouch behind the strong. Few men were willing to brave military service at all. The men who carried baskets had not been socialized to embrace battle, and...</p><h2>Helen M Stevens Embroiderer&#39;s Countryside (Helen Stevens&#39; Masterclass Embroidery) (Helen Stevens&#39; Masterclass Embroidery (Paperback))</h2><p>This new edition of Helen M.

At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy.

That's partially true. Herbs have always been near and dear to my heart, and they still are. However, research over the past few decades has taken the Green Pharmacy in a new and interesting direction--away from the health food store and into the supermarket.<br><br>A growing body of literature indicates that a number of plant foods-- fruits, vegetables, spices, and even beverages--offer many of the same healing powers that you'll find in herbal remedies. Foods, however, have a distinct advantage over their herbal cousins: Instead of depending on capsules, tinctures, and teas, you can incorporate foods into delicious, flavorful meals that are as satisfying as they are healing!<br><br>Of course, we all know that fruits and vegetables are healthful. That's why the government recently increased its recommendation from five servings to nine a day. But only now are we learning just how healthful they really are. To begin with, they're high in fiber, low in calories, and devoid of or low in harmful fats. But that's not all. Most have hundreds, if not thousands, of medicinal com�ds, each of which has a specific impact on your health and well-being. As a result, you can choose to add various plants to your diet to treat certain ailments. For example, I eat celery almost every day to prevent the pain associated with gout, and garlic is part of my diet because I know it can benefit my heart and possibly even help control my chronic Lyme disease.<br><br>Over the next few pages, I'll give you some background on how plant foods heal, so you can gain a greater understanding of their role in your health. Then, in the chapters to come, I'll help you plan your own regimen to treat specific conditions with specific foods.<br><br>Food as a Historical Healer<br><br>The idea of "food as medicine" is hardly a new one. In fact, when you consider that ancient man lacked the technological capability of today's chemists, it only makes sense that their medicines came directly from nature.<br><br>In fact, evidence of using food to heal dates back thousands of years. Ayurveda, the traditional healing art of India, is a perfect example. It borrows many of its ideas from Hinduism, incorporating multiple therapies that include herbs, massage, and meditation. Ayurvedic practitioners may even go so far as to try a new diet to prevent or treat specific conditions. One medicinal food from Ayurveda may be familiar to you: turmeric, which often shows up as a spice in Asian cuisine. Aside from its unique flavor, turmeric may also prove a helpful treatment for people with arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, and some forms of cancer. Although the research evidence isn't yet conclusive, it's certainly highly suggestive, and my own experience using turmeric as an anti-inflammatory has been extraordinarily positive. (For more information on turmeric, see page 28.)<br><br>Ayurveda, also commonly referred to as Traditional Indian Medicine or Traditional Ayurvedic Medicine (TAM), shares this focus on food with another ancient form of medical practice, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). TCM works from the concepts of "yin" and "yang," which in ancient Chinese philosophy refer to the two fundamental forces in the universe--the aggressive, hot, go-get-'em force (yang); and the passive, lie back and chill out force (yin). You get sick when these two forces fall out of balance in your body.<br><br>By now you're probably wondering what all of this has to do with food. In TCM, the foods you eat are seen as having yin properties--cooling and moistening--or yang properties--warming and drying. Depending on the condition you have, your practitioner will help you make food choices to restore balance between the two forces. For example, if you have a mucus- producing cough from a cold, your balance is skewed toward the yin, so you'll want to treat it with warming, drying foods like ginger tea and hot vegetable soups. As you can see, we borrow some of our ideas for treating illness from the Chinese, whether we're aware of it or not!<br><br>Better Living through Chemistry?<br><br>TAM and TCM are a far cry from Western medicine, which views food as the source of nutrition but ignores its healing properties almost entirely. That's not to say the American view of the diet--seeking a balance among protein, carbohydrates, and fat--doesn't make sense. It does. But it's limited--very limited.<br><br>The Chinese and Indian approaches basically say that the body will react in certain ways to certain foods. After all, we have co-evolved with and made use of the plants in our environment throughout the history of our species, so it only stands to reason that we would develop special relationships with some of them, as we have with members of the animal kingdom.<br><br>Now contrast that with our notion of modern medicine, which I like to call "better living through chemistry." Most synthetic drugs have been in use for only a few decades rather than a few thousand years, so the body just isn't used to handling them as it handles foods.<br><br>What's more, most plant foods contain thousands of bioactive com�ds, each of which plays a unique role in the body. By contrast, the viewpoint of modern medicine is that we're looking for one "silver bullet," the so- called active ingredient--and all the other helpful com�ds in any specific plant are tossed out and forgotten.<br><br>I'm not saying that all drugs are bad. In fact, quite the opposite is true: Drugs have saved the lives of many people. But it's tough to argue with the numbers: In 2005, pharmaceuticals killed at least 140,000 people in the United States--that we know of. The number may be even higher. As far back as 2002, the esteemed Journal of the American Medical Association recognized this problem, calling adverse drug reactions "a leading cause of death in the United States."<br><br>Now compare that with herbs and supplements. Altogether, they caused an estimated 29 deaths in 2005. The numbers speak for themselves.<br><br>The purpose of this book is not to scare you away from taking your medicines. After all, I need to take pharmaceuticals myself every now and then. Rather, what I'm hoping you'll do is "think outside the pillbox" and realize that by taking a different approach to what you eat, many conditions--and the medicines needed to treat them--can potentially be avoided completely.<br><br>The Supplement Scare<br><br>As you've already seen, supplements have proven safer than pharmaceuticals. However, this doesn't necessarily place vitamin supplements beyond criticism. Their effectiveness, most notably that of the "big three" antioxidants--vitamins A, C, and E--has come into question in recent years.<br><br>In the recent HOPE (Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation) study, more than 10,000 heart disease patients received either 400 IU of vitamin E or a placebo every day for six years. At the end of the trial, the researchers concluded that vitamin E really didn't do much better than the placebo at preventing death or other adverse outcomes from heart disease.<br><br>Vitamin C is generally considered safe even at high doses (though more than 1,200 milligrams can cause diarrhea in some people). But recently, the effectiveness of "megadosing" with vitamin C for illnesses like colds and flu has come under some fire. As the National Institutes of Health points out, more than 30 clinical trials with more than 10,000 participants have looked into the role of vitamin C in preventing colds, and no significant reduction has been noted. Vitamin C supplements may play a role in reducing the duration of colds, however.<br><br>Vitamin A (which exists in foods in the form of pre-vitamin A as well as carotenoids such as beta-carotene) has also been studied in supplement form, and it has shown some effectiveness for some conditions. The evidence indicates, however, that if you smoke or drink alcohol, you may want to steer clear of supplementing with pure beta-carotene, since it could actually increase your risk of lung damage, including even lung cancer.<br><br>Again, none of this is meant to scare you away from supplements. Quite the contrary; I take a number of them, and I think that multivitamins are a great means of getting a full complement of healthy nutrients in an economical way. I just find it interesting that when a single, specific bioactive com�d is isolated, whether in a pharmaceutical or a supplement, the result is never as dramatic as people expect. That's because in nature, the com�d works in combination with many others to bring healthful benefits to the body. Those combinations exist in only one place--whole foods!<br><br>The Food Renaissance<br><br>In recent years, you've probably noticed that you're hearing less about familiar nutrients, such as vitamins A, C, and E, in nutrition news and more about exotic-sounding ones, such as lycopene, quercetin, and resveratrol, to name a few. The reason is simple: Researchers are beginning to look beyond the macronutrients in foods, and they're discovering micronutrients and phytochemicals.<br><br>Some of the benefits these com�ds offer stem from their antioxidant potential. In the simplest terms, antioxidants help your body by neutralizing free radicals, unstable oxygen molecules that the body can overproduce after exposure to toxins such as cigarette smoke, pollution, and even unhealthful foods. Beyond their antioxidant potential, many com�ds help specific parts of the body remain healthy as well. Beta- carotene, lutein, and cryptoxanthin are good for your eyes. Phytoestrogens fight cancer. Capsaicin attacks arthritis pain. The list goes on and on.<br><br>The practical result of these new research discoveries is clear: Emphasis is shifting back to eating lots of healthful whole foods, particularly fruits and vegetables. And when the USDA plays along (which they did in 2005 by increasing their recommendation to nine servings of fruits and vegetables a day), you know we're making progress.<br><br>As I said earlier, I believe you can specifically tailor your diet to prevent or even reduce the symptoms related to a number of specific medical conditions--conditions as benign as a flaky scalp or as serious as a heart attack.<br><br>We'll have plenty of time to go over all these foods and the conditions they treat in the chapters ahead. First, though, let's look at an overview of some of the "heavy hitters" of the nutrition world as well as a rundown of some cutting-edge cures that we've only recently learned about.<br><br>What's Hot in Foods Now<br><br>When it comes to nutritional stars, it's funny how certain nutrients seem to go in and out of fashion. For a while, vitamins A, C, and E were hot. Now omega-3 fatty acids, lycopene, and vitamin D are getting all the attention. Next month, it may be something else.<br><br>However, just because a nutrient slips out of the limelight doesn't mean that it's no longer important to your health. Here's a quick look at some of the most important ones, from the old standbys to the new stars.<br><br>The Old Standbys<br><br>Though their reputation has taken a bit of a hit, it's still important to start any discussion of healing foods with the "big three" antioxidants-- vitamins A, C, and E.<br><br>Arguably the most famous of the three is vitamin C, found in abundance in foods like bell peppers, papayas, strawberries, and oranges and other citrus fruits. Some exotic fruits, like acerola, camu-camu, and emblic, rarely available in North American supermarkets, may be richer in C. In studies, vitamin C has been linked to the prevention of a number of diseases--most notably heart disease but also some cancers. As a matter of fact, the USDA phytochemical database lists nearly 100 activities for vitamin C, and I could probably double that number in a few minutes of surfing the Web. Research has shown that vitamin C may work more quickly than other antioxidants, blocking free radicals before others even arrive on the scene.<br><br>Another significant heart helper is vitamin E, which has reduced the risk of heart disease in a number of studies. This nutrient, found in vegetable oil, sunflower seeds, nuts, and sweet potatoes, has also shown that it may help fight off lung and prostate cancer. Some evidence indicates that vitamin E is even more effective when consumed with vitamin C, reinforcing the idea that eating a variety of fruits and vegetables gives you the most benefits.<br><br>Finally, we can't overlook vitamin A. It has gotten its fair share of bad press in recent years, and some studies have even linked it to increased risks of heart disease and cancer. However, it's important to remember that these studies looked at high doses from supplements. The main source of this antioxidant available from foods is beta-carotene, which your body converts into vitamin A. When people stick to the amounts of beta-carotene present in orange and yellow foods such as carrots, squash, cantaloupe, and sweet potatoes, the antioxidant is considered quite healthful.<br><br>Naturally, these aren't the only important nutrients, and they're not the only ones I focus on in my own regimen. A lesser-known but equally important antioxidant is selenium (just three Brazil nuts supply a whopping 200 micrograms). The whole range of B vitamins may play a role in preventing the symptoms of neuropathy, a common nerve disorder, and some studies suggest they can treat or prevent Alzheimer's disease. And I focus on getting plenty of magnesium to prevent nighttime leg cramps.<br><br>Here again, it all comes back to focusing on a variety of foods to get a balanced intake of all the important nutrients! You can go to the USDA phytochemical database (www.pl.barc.usda.gov/usda_chem/achem_home.cfm) and search for the richest sources of thousands of nutrients and phytochemicals.<br><br>The Right Kinds of Fats<br><br>Aside from abundant amounts of antioxidant nutrients, the other thing that plant foods have going for them is that they're relatively devoid of the type of fat found in red meat and dairy products, which can harm your heart; and some have fats that are actually good for you. Certain nuts, olive oil, and avocados, for example, have monounsaturated fats, which seem to raise levels of "good" HDL cholesterol while leaving "bad" LDL and total cholesterol levels unchanged.<br><br>Another group of beneficial fats currently getting a lot of attention are the omega-3 fatty acids. Though fatty fish like salmon and tuna are usually cited as the best sources of omega-3's, the fish actually acquire them by eating primitive plant forms such as algae, which manufacture these acids.<br><br>There is a handful of rich plant sources that provide an omega-3 called alphalinolenic acid (ALA), which can offer some but usually not all of the health benefits of the "fishy" omega-3's. Flaxseed and hempseed have omega- 3's, specifically ALA, in abundance, but a tastier plant source is walnuts. (For more on walnuts, see page 29.)<br><br>Recently I learned that chia, of Chia Pet fame, is even richer in ALA. I'm having an Amazonian acquisition, called Inca peanut (Plukenetia volubilis, not related to the real peanut, Arachis hypogaea), analyzed as another contender. And in my Green Farmacy Garden, there's a weed that many Asians consume with sushi. It's called perilla, and it has more ALA than the better-known flaxseed.<br><br>The New Stars</p><h2>The Colours of Murder: A Susie Mahl Mystery</h2><p><b>The second Susie Mahl Mystery.

Set in a small mid-American town, it begins with a coal-mine explosion that claims ninety-seven lives. Giovanni Bruno--hawk-faced, silent, some say deranged--is the only survivor. A lapsed Catholic given to peculiar visions, Bruno is adopted as a prophet by a group of secretive small-town mystics. "Exposed" by the town newspaper editor, the Brunist cult gains international notoriety and its ranks swell. As its members gather on the Mount of Redemption--above the site of the mine disaster--to await the apocalypse, and the fabric of the community begins to unravel, Robert Coover lays bare the madness of religious frenzy and the sometime greater madness of "normal" citizens. The Origin of the Brunists is vintage Coover-fearless, incisive, and brilliantly executed. <p>"A novel of intensity and conviction...[Coover] may become heir to Dreiser or Lewis....

He has taught at Bard College, the University of Iowa, Princeton University and currently teaches electronic and experimental writing at Brown University.</p>Robert Coover has published fourteen novels, three short story collections, and a collection of plays since The Origin of the Brunists received the The William Faulkner Foundation First Novel Award in 1966. At Brown University, where he has taught for over thirty years, he established the International Writers Project, a program that provides an annual fellowship and safe haven to endangered international writers who face harassment, imprisonment, and suppression of their work in their home countries. In 1990-91, he launched the world's first hypertext fiction workshop, was one of the founders in 1999 of the Electronic Literature Organization, and in 2002 created CaveWriting, the first writing workshop in immersive virtual reality. Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times has said Of all the postmodern writers, Robert Coover is probably the funniest and most malicious, mixing up broad social and political satire with vaudeville turns, lewd pratfalls, and clever word plays that make us rethink both the mechanics of the world and our relationship to it.&#x201d; Coover has also received awards from the Lannan Foundation, American Academy of Arts and Letters, National Endowment of the Arts, and the Rea Lifetime Short Story Award.</p><h2>Novice, The</h2><p><p>Fans of Thich Nhat Hanh&#x2019;s <em>Peace is Every Step</em> and <em>Anger</em>, and Deepak Chopra&#x2019;s <em>Buddha,</em> will appreciate Hanh&#x2019;s wisdom and storytelling in his novel <em>The Novice,</em> which contains universal themes that transcend all boundaries of faith, creed, country, and era.</p><p>Through the parable of a young woman who stays true to herself and her faith in the face of adversity, Vietnamese Zen Buddhist master and peace activist Thich Nhat Hanh enables readers to embark on their own path of introspection and self-discovery.</p><p>With his trademark insight, Hanh presents a path to greater awareness of the means to manifest peace both inside oneself and in the world at large.</p></p><p><p>A timeless message of ancient wisdom</p><p>bestselling author and Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh transforms an ancient folktale into a timeless parable of a young woman who dares to risk her life and her faith. with this elegant teaching, he reminds us that we all face our own injustices and suffering.

As the story unfolds, two stepsiblings hold together amidst schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, family breakdown, animal telepathy, misguided love, and the tiniest hope that everything will someday make sense.<br><br>Deliberately paced, delicately drawn, and drenched in shadows, <i>Swallow Me Whole</i> is a landmark achievement for Nate Powell and a suburban ghost story that will haunt readers long after its final pages.<br><br>2009 Eisner Award Winner for Best Graphic Album (New), Eisner Award Nominee for Best Writer/Artist and Best Lettering, 2009 <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize Finalist for Young Adult Fiction, Ignatz Award Winner for Outstanding Artist and Outstanding Debut, and official selection of YALSA's Great Graphic Novels For Teens.</p><p>Nate Powell was born in 1978 in Little Rock, Arkansas, and began self-publishing comics in 1992 at age 14.

He currently lives in Bloomington, Indiana with his wife Rachel Bormann.Grade 10 Up&#x2014;Powell has created a complex tale of two adolescent step-siblings struggling through the usual angst and discovery that occur during the teenage years. However, for Ruth and Perry, mental illness makes this time even more difficult. Ruth, who is at the center of the story, suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder and patterns of schizophrenia. Infatuated with insects, she keeps collections of them in jars in her room and is constantly arranging and rearranging them. She hallucinates that masses of insects surround her and fears stepping on any living thing. For Ruth, the simplest tasks present huge challenges. Perry fights his own demon as he tries to rid himself of a small wizard who persistently appears and makes him draw. The author's treatment of mental illness is realistic and sensitive. Readers are brought into the experiences of the characters and empathize with them. The relationships Ruth and Perry have with each other and with other family members are honest and lovingly portrayed. Every word in this graphic novel is carefully chosen, dialogue is realistic, and background "noise" masterfully done. Powell's detailed pen-and-ink drawings are well executed with lettering and images so brilliantly intertwined that they are one and the same. While the complexity and subject matter of <i>Swallow Me Whole</i> will not appeal to everyone, those teens who pick it up will discover a poignant story.&#x2014;<i>Lara McAllister, Halifax Public Libraries, Nova Scotia</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Each story provides a portrait of an individual's valiant and inspiring campaign to improve the conditions for life on our planet. Taken together, the work of these people points the way toward creating an ecologically centered civilization in which a brighter future for all life, including human, is possible.<br>*Terri Swearingen takes on one of the world's largest hazardous waste incinerators burning toxic waste next door to an elementary school.<br>*Stephen Schneider establishes the scientific basis for climate change<br>*Herman Daly advocates a dynamic steady-state economy that respects the laws of nature and human behavior.<br>*David Orr champions educational reform to make universities a place where students learn how to be environmentally aware citizens<br>*Werner Fornos works toward empowering every person with the knowledge and means to decide when and how many children to have<br>*Helena Norberg-Hodge champions local living with appropriate technologies to enhance our spiritual and ecological well-being.<br>*Wes Jackson promotes sustainable agriculture based on local ecology and community values<br>*Dave Foreman leads the effort to rewild almost half of North America with wolves, mountain lions, jaguars, falcons, and others to restore functional ecosystems and preserve biodiversity<br></p><p>By personalizing critical environmental issues via profiles of eight "visionaries" agitating for a more livable planet, this informative if occasionally wordy work brings something new to the Earth-activist bookshelf. McDaniel (coauthor, <i>Paradise for Sale</i>) certainly covers his ecological bases: his subjects are prominent in the areas of hazardous waste incineration, biodiversity, sustainable agriculture, appropriate technology, population control, rational economic planning, climate concerns and environmental education; their unflagging enthusiasm for the well-being of the planet infuses the book, which at times veers toward the pedantic, with a redemptive, zealous energy. The portrait of Teri Swearingen is the most accessible: for two decades, the West Virginia nurse and mother fought construction of a toxic-waste incinerator near an elementary school. The portrait of Wes Jackson is the most inspirational: for almost three decades, the geneticist's Land Institute in Kansas has worked to spread the word about farming practices that preserve good soil rather than poison it. And the portrait of David Orr is perhaps the most forward looking: the professor of environmental studies at Oberlin College believes that Earth's future lies in developing "culture-transforming" environmental education. The stories of these eight ecological warriors are profoundly appealing in that they show the diverse ways that people can commit to a common cause. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Catastrophic natural disasters remind us that we are part of nature and at the mercy of nature, yet we assume that everyday environmental disorders won't affect our lives. Not so, says biologist McDaniel and the eight inspired activists, educators, and scientists he profiles. Adept at cogent explanations of complex matters, McDaniel uses the groundbreaking work of the visionaries he portrays as starting points for clarifying reports on concerns ranging from climate change to the need for "rewilding" to restore biodiversity. But it is the personal element that makes each issue resonate in this engaging, often moving group portrait. McDaniel spends time with all of the innovative thinkers as he tells the inside stories of their callings and the adversity they face. Nurse Terri Swearingen became an intrepid activist when a huge toxic waste incinerator was built next door to a local elementary school. Wes Jackson coined the term and now seeks to practice "sustainable agriculture." Economist Herman Daly advocates for a "steady-state economy" in sync with ecological realities. By combining biography with crucial information and thought-provoking analysis, McDaniel creates an ecological and philosophical atlas mapping where we stand today and which paths we should follow for a more environmentally sound tomorrow. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It presents psychological ideas as part of a greater web of thinking throughout history about the essentials of human nature, interwoven with ideas from philosophy, science, religion, art, literature, and politics.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daniel N. Robinson demonstrates that from the dawn of rigorous and self-critical inquiry in ancient Greece, reflections about human nature have been inextricably linked to the cultures from which they arose, and each definable historical age has added its own character and tone to this long tradition. An Intellectual History of Psychology not only explores the most significant ideas about human nature from ancient to modern times, but also examines the broader social and scientific contexts in which these concepts were articulated and defended. Robinson treats each epoch, whether ancient Greece or Renaissance Florence or Enlightenment France, in its own terms, revealing the problems that dominated the age and engaged the energies of leading thinkers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robinson also explores the abiding tension between humanistic and scientific perspectives, assessing the most convincing positions on each side of the debate. Invaluable as a text for students and as a stimulating and insightful overview for scholars and practicing psychologists, this volume can be read either as a history of psychology in both its philosophical and aspiring scientific periods or as a concise history of Western philosophy&#x2019;s concepts of human nature.</p></p><p>Daniel N. Robinson is professor of psychology at Georgetown University. His many books include<i>Toward a Science of Human Nature: Essays on the Psychologies of Hegel, Mill, Wundt, and James</i>;<i>Philosophy of Psychology</i>; and <i>Aristotle&#x2019;s Psychology</i>. He was chief consultant for the PBS television series<i>The Brain and The Mind</i>.Twenty years in the making, including two prior editions, this work conveys a deep, calm mastery of the subject. Philosopher and psychologist Robinson (Toward a Science of Human Nature, Columbia Univ. Pr., 1982) guides the reader from the pre-Socratics to Skinner, passing through Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Luther, Kant, Spinoza, Nietzsche, and many others, including Weyer, Mesmer, and Charcot. Along the way, Robinson convinces the reader that "the view of reason and appetite as opposing forces is as old as the Homeric epics and as current as psychoanalytic theory." He also raises questions about the darkness of the "Dark" ages and the brightness of the Renaissance. Convinced that "psychology is the history of ideas," Robinson treats every idea and every sentence with critical respect, making this a standard-setting book that is also a pleasure to read.?E.

Is it possible to craft a mode of philosophy, ethics, and interpretation that rejects the classic humanist divisions of self and other, mind and body, society and nature, human and animal, organic and technological? Can a new kind of humanities-posthumanities-respond to the redefinition of humanity's place in the world by both the technological and the biological or "green" continuum in which the "human" is but one life form among many?</p><p> Exploring how both critical thought along with cultural practice have reacted to this radical repositioning, Cary Wolfe-one of the founding figures in the field of animal studies and posthumanist theory-ranges across bioethics, cognitive science, animal ethics, gender, and disability to develop a theoretical and philosophical approach responsive to our changing understanding of ourselves and our world. Then, in performing posthumanist readings of such diverse works as Temple Grandin's writings, Wallace Stevens's poetry, Lars von Trier's <i>Dancer in the Dark</i>, the architecture of Diller+Scofidio, and David Byrne and Brian Eno's <i>My Life in the Bush of Ghosts</i>, he shows how this philosophical sensibility can transform art and culture. </p><p>For Wolfe, a vibrant, rigorous posthumanism is vital for addressing questions of ethics and justice, language and trans-species communication, social systems and their inclusions and exclusions, and the intellectual aspirations of interdisciplinarity. In <i>What Is Posthumanism?</i> he carefully distinguishes posthumanism from transhumanism (the biotechnological enhancement of human beings) and narrow definitions of the posthuman as the hoped-for transcendence of materiality. In doing so, Wolfe reveals that it is humanism, not the human in all its embodied and prosthetic complexity, that is left behind in posthumanist thought.</p></p><p>Cary Wolfe is Bruce and Elizabeth Dunlevie Professor of English at Rice University.

Or is he? In H. G. Wells' acclaimed tale, a stranded mountaineer encounters an isolated society in which his apparent advantage proves less than valuable. This thought-provoking fable is accompanied by other short stories, including "The Star," a gripping tale about a massive celestial object hurtling toward the Earth, as well as "The New Accelerator," "The Remarkable Case of Davidson's Eyes," "Under the Knife," and "The Queer Story of Brownlow's Newspaper." <br>With the 1895 publication of his first novel, <i>The Time Machine,</i> Wells established himself as the foremost science-fiction writer of his era. This entertaining collection was selected and edited by Martin Gardner, who also provides an Afterword that offers insight into the liveliness and originality of Wells&#x2019; imagination.</p><p>A pioneer of science fiction, H. G. Wells (1866-1946) wrote thrilling adventures about time travel, space exploration, alien invasion, and scientific experiments gone awry. His tales of obsession, revelation, and discovery remain compellingly readable and relevant.</p><h2>Of Arms and Artists: The American Revolution through Painters&#39; Eyes</h2><p><p><b>A vibrant and original perspective on the American Revolution through the stories of the five great artists whose paintings animated the new American republic.</b></p><p>The images accompanying the founding of the United States--of honored Founders, dramatic battle scenes, and seminal moments--gave visual shape to Revolutionary events and symbolized an entirely new concept of leadership and government. Since then they have endured as indispensable icons, serving as historical documents and timeless reminders of the nation's unprecedented beginnings. </p><p>As Paul Staiti reveals in <i>Of Arms and Artists</i>, the lives of the five great American artists of the Revolutionary period--Charles Willson Peale, John Singleton Copley, John Trumbull, Benjamin West, and Gilbert Stuart--were every bit as eventful as those of the Founders with whom they continually interacted, and their works contributed mightily to America's founding spirit. Living in a time of breathtaking change, each in his own way came to grips with the history being made by turning to brushes and canvases, the results often eliciting awe and praise, and sometimes scorn. Ever since the passing of the last eyewitnesses to the Revolution, their imagery has connected Americans to 1776, allowing us to interpret and reinterpret the nation's beginning generation after generation. The collective stories of these five artists open a fresh window on the Revolutionary era, making more human the figures we have long honored as our Founders, and deepening our understanding of the whirlwind out of which the United States emerged.</p></p><p><b>Paul Staiti</b> teaches at Mount Holyoke College and is the author of several books and essays on American artists.

A lively, splendid history that captures the times with insight, acumen, and a juggler's finesse." - starred review, <i>Kirkus</i></p><p>"In his rousing overture to this altogether exciting and innovative history of the American Revolution, professor of fine arts Staiti reminds us that patriotism requires a shared identity and shared values, and that this conceptual unity is created, in part, by powerful and heroic images. . . . . Staiti brings new vibrancy and meaning to boldly revolutionary paintings that both commemorate the suffering, conviction, and valor of a specific time and address the timeless struggle for justice and freedom." - starred review, <i>Booklist</i></p><p>"Staiti skillfully shows how the Founding Fathers were attuned to the importance of visual art in constructing a public image and how they collaborated with artists to, ultimately, shape history. . . .

These were the kind of earsplitting screams that would make the strongest department-store Santa want to run for his sleigh. Her face was a perfect match for James Claussen's red Santa suit, and both her eyes and her nose had the spigot turned on full blast.<br><br>What was he doing here, sitting on this uncomfortable throne, ruling over a kingdom of fake snow, candy canes and mechanical reindeer? What had possessed him to come back to work? He didn't want to be jolly, even imitation jolly.<br><br>"Come on, Joy," coaxed the little girl's mother from her spot on the sidelines of Santa Land. "Smile for Mommy."<br><br>"Waaah," Joy responded.<br><br><em>I understand how you feel,</em> James thought. "Joy, that's a pretty name for a pretty girl. Can you give your mommy a big smile?" he coaxed.<br><br>"Waaah," Joy shrieked, and began kicking her feet. The black patent leather shoes turned those little feet into lethal weapons. Come tomorrow he'd have a bruise on the inside of his left thigh.<br><br>"Ho, ho, ho," James tried, but the shrieks only got louder.<br><br>Okay, this was as good as the picture with Santa was going to get. He stood and handed off the child, who was still kicking and crying, barely dodging an assault to the family jewels in the process. The jewels weren't so perfect now that he was sixty-six but they were still valuable to him and he wanted to keep them.<br><br>Shauna Sullivan, his loyal elf, sent him a sympathetic look and ushered up the next child, a baby girl carried by her mother. Rosy-cheeked and alert, probably just awake from a nap, the baby was dolled up in a red velvet dress with white booties on her feet and a headband decorated with a red flower. She was old enough to smile and coo but not quite old enough to walk or, thank God, kick Santa where it hurt.<br><br>This baby girl reminded him of his daughter, Brooke, when she was a baby, all smiles and dimples. Big brown eyes that looked at him in delighted wonder. Oh, those were the days, when his kids were small and Faith was still...<br><br><em>Don't go there.</em><br><br>"And what would this little dumpling like for Christmas?" he asked, settling the baby on his lap. For a few seconds it looked as if she was actually concentrating on an answer. But then a sound anyone who'd had children could easily recognize, followed by a foul odor, told him she'd been concentrating on something else. Oh, man.<br><br>"Smile, Santa," Krystal, the photographer, teased, and the smelly baby on his lap gurgled happily.<br><br>James had never been good with poopy diapers but he gave it his best effort and hoped he looked like a proper Santa.<br><br>Finally, they were down to the last kid in line. Thank God. After this, Santa was going home to enjoy a cold beer.<br><br>That was about the only thing he'd enjoy. Oh, he'd turn on the TV to some cop show, but he wouldn't really watch it. Then he'd go to bed and wish the days wouldn't keep coming, forcing him to move on.<br><br>He especially dreaded the next day, December 24. How he wished he could skip right to New Year's Day. Or better yet, go backward to New Year's Day two years ago, when he and Faith were planning their European cruise.<br><br><em>Stay in the moment,</em> he told himself. <em>Stay in character.</em> He put on his jolliest Santa face and held out a welcoming arm to the next child.<br><br>This one was going to be a terror; he could tell by the scowl on the kid's freckled face as he approached. He was a big, hefty burger of a boy, wearing jeans and an oversize T-shirt, and could have been anywhere between the ages of ten and thirteen. Logic ruled out the older end of the spectrum. Usually by about eight or nine, kids stopped believing.<br><br>"And who have we got here?" James asked in his jolly I-love-kids voice.<br><br>Normally he did love kids and he loved playing Santa, had been doing it since his children were little. He'd always had the husky build for it, although when he was younger Faith had padded him out with a pillow. No pillow necessary now. And no need for a fake beard, either. Mother Nature had turned his beard white over the past few years.<br><br>These days he wasn't into the role, wasn't into Christmas, period. Santa had lost his holiday spirit and he was starting to lose his patience, too. Very un-Santa-like. He should never have agreed to fill in today, should have told Holiday Memories to find another Santa.<br><br>His new customer didn't answer him.<br><br>"What's your name, son?" he asked, trying again.<br><br>"Richie," said the boy, and landed on James's leg like a ton of coal.<br><br>"And how old are you, Richie?"<br><br>"Too old for this. This is stupid." The kid crossed his arms and glared at his mother.<br><br>"So you're twelve?" James guessed.<br><br>"I'm ten and I know there's no such thing as Santa. You're a big fake."<br><br>Boy, he had that right.<br><br>"And that's fake, too," Richie added.<br><br>James was usually prepared for rotten-kid beard assaults, but this year his game was off and Richie got a handful of beard before James could stop him. He yanked so hard he nearly separated James's jawbone from the rest of his skull. For a moment there he saw stars, and two Richies. As if one wasn't bad enough.<br><br>"Whoa there, son, that's real," James said, rubbing his chin, his eyes watering. "Let's take it easy on old Santa."<br><br>Now Richie's mother was glaring, too, as though it was James's fault she'd spawned a monster.<br><br>"Look, Richie," he said, lowering his voice. "We're both men here. We know this is all pretend."<br><br><em>And Christmas is a crock and life sucks. So deal with it, you little fart.</em><br><br>James reeled in his bad Santa before he could get loose and do any damage. Good Santa continued, "But your mom wants this picture. One last picture she can send to your relatives and brag about what a great kid you are." <em>Not.</em> "Can you man-up and pose so she can have a nice picture of you for Christmas?"<br><br>Richie scowled at him suspiciously, as if he was up to some strange trick.<br><br>James sweetened the holiday pot. "I bet if you do, you'll get what you want for Christmas." Now the kid was looking less adversarial. James pressed his advantage. "Come on, kid. One smile and we can both get out of here. Whaddya say?"<br><br>Richie grunted and managed half a smile and Krystal captured it. "But you're still a fake," Richie said.<br><br><em>And you're still a little fart.</em> "Ho, ho, ho," James replied, and rocketed the boy off his leg, sending him flying.<br><br>"Hey, he shoved me," Richie said to his mother, and pointed an accusing finger at James.<br><br>"Trick leg," James said apologetically. "Old war injury. Merry Christmas," he called and, with a wave, abdicated his holiday throne.<br><br>"Okay," he said to Shauna, "I'm out of here." Thank God today was over. He was never doing this again. He didn't care if every Santa on the planet was home with the flu.<br><br>"You can't go yet," she protested, and began looking desperately around the mall.<br><br>After a ten-hour day? Oh, yeah, he could. "No kids, and it's ten minutes till the end of our shift. We'll be okay to leave. Right, Krystal?"<br><br>Krystal frowned. "Well."<br><br>It was nearly five o'clock. All the moms and kiddies were now on their way home to make dinner. The next Santa crew would arrive soon to deal with the evening crowd. All they had to do was put up the Santa-will-be-back sign. What was the problem? Maybe Shauna and Krystal felt guilty about stealing a couple of extra minutes from work.<br><br>Not James. He'd worked hard all his life and he had no qualms about stealing a few minutes for himself now. For over forty years he'd been a welder at Boeing. Then he'd come home and work some more, putting that addition on the house, mowing the lawn, cleaning the garage, repairing broken faucets.<br><br>Of course, he'd also realized the importance of playing&#x2014;backyard baseball with the kids, Frisbee at the park, board games on a rainy Sunday afternoon. And real life had taught him that you had to take advantage of everything good, even little things like getting off ten minutes early. Because you never knew what cosmic pie in the face was waiting for you around the corner.<br><br>"Come on, ladies," he said, putting an arm around each of them and trying to move them in the direction of the Starbucks. "The eggnog lattes are on me." They still balked. He'd never known the women to turn down a latte. He glanced from one to the other. "Okay, what's going on?"<br><br>"It's a surprise," Shauna said.<br><br>James frowned. He hated surprises, had hated them ever since Faith got sick.<br><br>"It's a good one," Krystal said as if reading his mind.<br><br>And then he saw his daughter hurrying down the mall toward him and the heaviness settling over him was blown away. There she was, his brown-eyed girl, all bundled up in boots and black leggings and a winter coat, her hair falling to her shoulders in a stylish light brown sheet. Once upon a time, it had been curly and so cute. Then suddenly she'd decided she needed to straighten her hair. He never could understand why the curls had to go. But then he'd never understood women's fashion.<br><br>He'd also never understood why she thought her face was too round or why she thought she was fat. Her face was sweet. And she was just curvy. As far as he was concerned she was the prettiest young woman in Seattle. That wasn't fatherly prejudice. It was fact, plain and simple.<br><br>"Daddy," she called, and waved and began to run toward him.<br><br>Krystal had been right. This was a good surprise.<br><br>"Hello there, angel," he greeted her, and gave her a big hug. "Did you come so your old man could take you to dinner?"<br><br>"I came to take my old man somewhere special for Christmas," she said. "Thanks for not letting him get away," she told his holiday helpers.<br><br>"No problem," said Shauna. "Have a great time."<br><br>"For Christmas?" James repeated as Brooke linked her arm through his and started them walking toward the shopping mall's main entrance.<br><br>They were going somewhere for Christmas on the twenty-third? Did that mean she wouldn't be spending Christmas with him and Dylan? It was their first Christmas without Faith (well, technically their second since she'd died on December 24 the year before). He'd assumed he and his son and daughter would all be together to help one another through the holidays.<br><br>But she was an adult. She could do what she wanted. Maybe she'd made plans with friends. If she had, he couldn't blame her for wanting to escape unpleasant memories. Maybe she'd found someone in the past couple of weeks and wanted to be with him. She shouldn't have to babysit her dad.<br><br>"Don't worry, Daddy," she said. "I've got it all under control."<br><br>He didn't doubt that. Like her mother, Brooke was a planner and an organizer. She'd organized their Thanksgiving dinner, gathering his sister and his cousin and her husband, assigning everyone dishes to bring.<br><br>But what was she talking about? "Got what under control?"<br><br>"You'll see," she said with a Santa-like twinkle in her eyes.<br><br>Oh, boy, another surprise. "What are you up to, angel?"<br><br>"I'm not telling, but trust me, you'll like it."<br><br>He wouldn't like <em>anything</em> this season but he decided to play along. "Okay, lead on."<br><br>He hoped she hadn't spent too much money. Kindergarten teachers didn't make a lot and he hated to think of her spending a fortune on some fancy meal. He'd be happy enough with a hamburger. Anyway, he'd rather eat in the car than go into a restaurant dressed in his Santa suit.<br><br>They were out of the mall now and at her trusty SUV. She complained about her gas mileage but he was secretly glad she had this vehicle. It had all-wheel drive and handled well in the snow, so he didn't have to worry about her when she was driving in bad weather. Seattle rarely got much of the white stuff, but they'd had a couple of inches earlier in the month and the weatherman was predicting more by New Year's.<br><br>James had always loved it when they had a white Christmas. It meant snowball fights with the kids and hot chocolate afterward. Faith would lace his and hers with peppermint schnapps.<br><br>"No frowning allowed," Brooke said as they got in.<br><br>"Who's frowning? Santa doesn't frown."<br><br>"He never used to," Brooke said softly.<br><br>"Well, Santa's getting too grumpy for this job. It's about time for the old boy to pack it in."<br><br>His daughter shot a startled look in his direction. "Daddy, are you crazy?"<br><br>"No, I'm just..." <em>Sick of this ho-ho-ho crap.</em> It would never do to say such a cynical thing to his daughter. "Ready for a break," he improvised.<br><br>"You can't take a break," she protested as she drove out of the parking lot. "You're Santa."<br><br>James studied the crowd of cars rushing around them, people busy running errands, going places, preparing for holiday gatherings with loved ones. Most of the men in Seattle would be out the following day, frantically finding gifts for their women. He wished he was going to be one of them.<br><br>He reminded himself that he still had his kids. He had a lot for which to be thankful, and if Brooke had plans for Christmas, well, he and Dylan could make turkey TV dinners and eat the last of the cookies she'd baked for them, then watch a movie, like <em>Bad Santa.</em> Heh, heh, heh.<br><br>Now they were on the southbound freeway. Where were they going? Knowing his daughter, it would be someplace special.<br><br>He smiled as he thought about the contrast between her and his son. Dylan would come up with something at the last minute, most likely a six-pack of beer and a bag of nachos, their favorite football food. Naturally, Dylan would help him consume it all.</p><h2>The Revolution Of Everyday Life</h2><p>Finally, back in print again, the essential handbook for all of us still alienated by modern capitalism.

Native Funk and Flash sits alongside treasured costume and fashion bibles on the shelves of the great designers of our times. Many artists, now in their prime, credit their early encounter with it for their own choice of career and inspiration. Within these pages hand-embroidered and hand-painted imagery enhance dear old shirts and jeans, serving the dual purpose of extending their usefulness and emblazoning the wearer with messages of love, psychedelic daydreams, and mysticism for all to see. The ethos of a generation is captured here: the scenes, sound, smell, look, politics, spirit, and most of all, the love is expressed in this moment in time when people cared so deeply for one another and the future that they wore it on their sleeves. Carved wooden doors, chairs, handmade fanciful shoes, beads, leather, incredible jewelry, a playground, patched upholstery-everything was fair game for inventive self-expression, whether one was a skilled adept or a beginner with a dream. No craft or design collection should be without this book.</p><p></p><h2>Swearing Is Good for You: The Amazing Science of Bad Language</h2><p><p><strong>An irreverent and impeccably researched defense of our dirtiest words.</strong></p><p>We&#x2019;re often told that swearing is outrageous or even offensive, that it&#x2019;s a sign of a stunted vocabulary or a limited intellect. Dictionaries have traditionally omitted it and parents forbid it. But the latest research by neuroscientists, psychologists, sociologists, and others has revealed that swear words, curses, and oaths&#x2015;when used judiciously&#x2015;can have surprising benefits.</p><p>In this sparkling debut work of popular science, Emma Byrne examines the latest research to show how swearing can be good for you. With humor and colorful language, she explores every angle of swearing&#x2015;why we do it, how we do it, and what it tells us about ourselves. Not only has some form of swearing existed since the earliest humans began to communicate, but it has been shown to reduce physical pain, to lower anxiety, to prevent physical violence, to help trauma victims recover language, and to promote human cooperation.

We argue about whether it's at risk, whether college students fear it, whether neo-Nazis deserve it, and whether the government is adequately upholding it.<br><br>But as P. E. Moskowitz provocatively shows in <i>The Case Against Free Speech</i>, the term has been defined and redefined to suit those in power, and in recent years, it has been captured by the Right to push their agenda. What's more, our investment in the First Amendment obscures an uncomfortable truth: free speech is impossible in an unequal society where a few corporations and the ultra-wealthy bankroll political movements, millions of voters are disenfranchised, and our government routinely silences critics of racism and capitalism.<br><br>Weaving together history and reporting from Charlottesville, Skokie, Standing Rock, and the college campuses where student protests made national headlines, Moskowitz argues that these flash points reveal more about the state of our democracy than they do about who is allowed to say what.<br><br>Our current definition of free speech replicates power while dissuading dissent, but a new ideal is emerging. In this forcefully argued, necessary corrective, Moskowitz makes the case for speech as a tool--for exposing the truth, demanding equality, and fighting for all our civil liberties.</p><p><b>P. E.

The main character, though, is the world of Northampton, irrevocably woven into the fabric of Western history, yet still grounded by the everyday concerns of health, money, food, love, and family. It is a novel of voices, the living and the dead, that illuminate the passage of time.<br><b><br></b></p><p><b>Brian Kiteley</b> is Professor of English and Creative Writing at the University of Denver, and the author of <i>Still Life With Insects</i>, <i>I Know Many Songs, But I Cannot Sing</i>, <i>The 3 A.M.

Breakthrough</i>.River Gods such as Israel Williams, 70 years old in March of 1779, alternate chapters with members of novelist Kiteley's own family: his grandfather, his parents, his gay brother, and various other inhabitants of Northampton.&nbsp; They speak in monologues, opening their minds and hearts to the reader as might, say, spirits at a seance, with the novelist as the inspired spiritualist.&nbsp; The result is an intense and beautiful collage of speeches in time about events in this one place from the familiar in every day to the divine.&nbsp; A 16-year-old Christian boy in the spring of 1738 says, Molly and I do not deceive out of fear of discovery, or because it pleases us to, because we do no one harm, and because we enjoy accumulating venal sins.&nbsp; Jump forward to 1989, and the novelist himself chants the names of Northampton Streets: First Square, Florence, Young Rainbow, Old Rainbow, Locust, Myrtle, Maple, Elm, Audubon, Evergreen.&nbsp; By this method, Northampton, Massachusetts, in this unlikely and memorable tribute to one writer's hometown, becomes everyone's location.&nbsp; <i>The River Gods</i> conjures up a local habitation by means of aesthetic magic.&nbsp; It's a meditation, a celebration, an investigation and an elegy.<b>&nbsp; </b>--Alan Cheuse, <i>All Things Considered </i>(NPR) <i><br>The River Gods</i> is a subtle portrait of the way the ripples in the human pond complicate one another.&nbsp; It tenderly examines the filaments that connect individual to family and family to town and town to nation and nation to world, and shows how rupture, love, death, and memory shiver their way up and down these filaments to create a delicate whole.&nbsp; A beautifully rendered investigation of joy and loss, and of the way in which longing and desire and regret can lap over the divide between life and death.&nbsp; --Brian Evenson <i><br>The River Gods </i>is a soft-spoken novel, filled with history and nuance and contemplative space.&nbsp; Told as a series of first-person accounts by historical characters in or around the town of Northampton, MA, the book effectively pulls about 400 years of that town's history into a collective narrative portrait.&nbsp; The form is spatial rather than linear.&nbsp; Kiteley moves forward and back through time, allowing each speaker his or her specific contemporaneity, so that the town's identity emerges not as a palimpsest--its present-day streets and houses and inhabitants "written over" its deep historical past--but rather as a kind of historical simultaneity: these people may have lived at different points in history, but they are all speaking right now in this book.&nbsp; These were real people, often famous ones (Jonathan Edwards, Sojourner Truth, William Carlos Williams), yet here their primary contribution to the identity of Northampton is not their historical relevance, but rather their assumptions, quirks, flaws, joys, walks, deaths, and all the other elements that composed their experiences of the world.&nbsp; The past comes to us with the same precision as the present, in the particular qualities of the people who lived here over time.&nbsp; --Martin Riker, <i>The Review of Contemporary Fiction</i></p><h2>How to Raise an Ox: Zen Practice as Taught in Master Dogen&#39;s Shobogenzo</h2><p>The writings of Zen master Dogen are among the highest achievements not only of Japanese literature but of world literature. Dogen&#39;s writings are a near-perfect expression of truth, beautifully expressing the best of which the human race is capable. In this volume, Francis Cook presents ten selections from Dogen&#39;s masterwork, the Shobogenzo, as well as six of his own essays brilliantly illuminating the mind of this peerless master.</p><p>As the numbers of Zen practitioners have grown dramatically, so has interest in Dogen, one of the founders of Zen in Japan. In <i>How to Raise an Ox</i>, translator Francis Cook presents 9 of the 95 chapters of Dogen's classic <i>Shobogenzo</i>, along with Dogen's "General Recommendations for Doing Zazen." These 10 chapters focus on Zen practice and Dogen's complex understanding of the relationship of practice to enlightenment. Using numerous illustrations from Chinese Zen masters, Dogen shows how enlightenment relates to the mind, emptiness, and leaving home, and how it is that to practice is to be enlightened. This is the kind of book you want to go back to again and again for guidance and insights, and Cook makes it that much easier to understand by introducing the main concepts in his lengthy introduction. And so with Dogen's help, Zen can be as easy as raising an ox. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Eihei Dogen founded the Japanese Soto School of Zen, and is renowned as one of the world's most remarkable religious thinkers. As Shakespeare does with English, Dogen utterly transforms the language of Zen, using it in novel and extraordinarily beautiful ways in his voluminous writings. Born in 1200 to an aristocratic background, he was ordained a monk in the Japanese Tendai School in his early teens, but became dissatisfied with Japanese Buddhism. After traveling in China from 1223 to 1227, he returned to introduce to Japan the Soto lineage and the large body of Chan teaching stories, or koans, which he had thoroughly mastered. From 1233 to 1243 he taught near the cultural capital of Kyoto, then in 1243 moved to the remote northern mountains and founded the temple Eiheiji, still one of the headquarter temples of Soto Zen. There, until his illness and death in 1253, he trained a core group of monks who spread&nbsp; Soto Zen throughout the Japanese countryside. Dogen's writings are noted for their poetic and philosophic depth, though aimed at spiritual practitioners. His two major, massive works are Shobogenzo (True Dharma Eye Treasury) and Eihei Koroku (Dogen's Extensive Record). Although not studied for many centuries aside from&nbsp; Soto scholars, in modern times Dogen's writings, through translation, have become an important part of the spread of Buddhism in the West.<br><br>Francis Dojun Cook was born and raised in a very small town in upstate New York in 1930. He was lucky to be an ordinary kid with ordinary parents. By means of true grit and luck, he managed to acquire several academic degrees and learn something about Buddhism. More luck in the form of a Fulbright Fellowship enabled him to study in Kyoto, Japan, for a year and a half, where he would have learned more had he not spent so much time admiring temple gardens. He now teaches Buddhism at the University of California, Riverside, and is director of translations at the Institute for Transcultural Studies in Los Angeles. He remains ordinary, but to his credit it can be said that he raised four good kids, has a great love for animals, and cooks pretty well. A sign that at last he is becoming more intelligent is that he became a student of Maezumi Roshi several years ago, the best thing he ever did. He is also the author of <i>Hua-yen Buddhism: The Jewel Net of Indra</i>, and of various articles on Buddhism in scholarly journals.<br><br>Hakuyu Taizan Maezumi (1931-95) was a Japanese Zen Buddhist teacher and roshi, and lineage holder in the Soto, Rinzai and Harada-Yasutani traditions of Zen. He combined the Rinzai use of koans and the Soto emphasis on shikantaza in his teachings, influenced by his years studying under Hakuun Yasutani in the Harada-Yasutani school. He founded or co-founded several institutions and practice centers, including the Zen Center of Los Angeles, White Plum Asanga, Yokoji Zen Mountain Center, and the Zen Mountain Monastery. Taizan Maezumi left behind twelve Dharma successors, appointed sixty-eight priests and gave Buddhist precepts to more than five hundred practitioners. Along with Zen teachers like Shunryu Suzuki-roshi, Seung Sahn Dae Soen Sa Nim, and Venerable Hsuan Hua, Maezumi greatly influenced the American Zen landscape. Several Dharma Successors of his-including Tetsugen Bernard Glassman, Dennis Merzel, John Daido Loori, Jan Chozen Bays, Gerry Shishin Wick, Charlotte Joko Beck, and William Nyogen Yeo-have gone on to found Zen communities of their own. Maezumi died unexpectedly while visiting Japan in 1995.</p><h2>Dancing Under the Red Star: The Extraordinary Story of Margaret Werner, the Only American Woman to Survive Stalin&#39;s Gulag</h2><p>The shocking and inspirational saga of Margaret Werner and her miraculous survival in the Siberian death camps of Stalinist Russia.<br><br>Between 1930 and 1932, Henry Ford sent 450 of his Detroit employees plus their families to live in Gorky, Russia, to operate a new manufacturing facility.

I was seventeen years old, and destiny was coming, whether I liked it or not.<br>When I awoke that morning, I think I already knew. In my heart, or maybe it was the pit of my stomach, I sensed there would be something out of the ordinary about this day. It was an eerie premonition, something you could unmistakably identify but not necessarily explain. Just in my waking up, the day already felt strangely surreal and separate from all others. It was an unusually splendid morning. The entire sky was uncommon, painted a crystal clear blue, with no clouds, and I felt oddly euphoric. And in the midst of the otherwise chaotic circumstances surrounding this time in my life, this day seemed filled with hope and promise, and I couldn&#x2019;t wait to get it started.<br>Peering out the window of our second-floor apartment in Gorky&#x2019;s American Village, I felt the warm and deceptively soothing rays of the Russian summer sunshine on my skin. I was eager to get outside, to meet my best friend, Maria, for a tennis match. I was surging with adrenaline and expectancy. My body, rather than my mind, was happy, perhaps outside of itself. And happy was not an easy thing to be in Russia, in those unpredictably turbulent days, when confusing changes were occurring all around us.<br>Through no choice of my own, Russia had become my home, although in my mind and in my heart, and sometimes even in my words, I still referred to it as a foreign country. This was not America, where I was born, and no matter how long I stayed, I simply did not belong here. This was not my true home! Here in Gorky, we feared that anything could happen at any moment, and no one ever really knew what to expect from one minute to the next. I speedily ate a very light breakfast, mainly to satisfy my mother&#x2019;s demands, then grabbed my tennis racket and hurriedly kissed Mama good-bye, nearly tripping over her feet as I jolted down the stairs to meet Maria.<br>The brick wall and empty lot of an abandoned storefront around the corner from our tenement was a perfect place to practice tennis by myself or when Maria could not play. We had planned to meet there that morning and then walk to the nearby tennis courts together. She hadn&#x2019;t arrived yet, so I decided to stretch and loosen up on my own. Maria was eighteen&#x2013;a beautiful, green-eyed Ukrainian girl who lived in our village because her father and older brother also worked in the automobile factory<br>with my father. She was an excellent athlete and competitor, a renowned young gymnast in her hometown, and now a topnotch tennis player here in the village. We enjoyed each other&#x2019;s company and athletic competitiveness immensely. In fact, Maria was the only other girl my age in the entire village whose love for sports and general athletic prowess rivaled mine. I&#x2019;m quite sure that&#x2019;s why we got along so well. Here in Gorky, Soviet sports had become my life. Athletic competition and organized sports were highly esteemed in Russia and taken very seriously. This suited me! Since early childhood back in Detroit, I had been raised to be athletic and physical, and my nature was to be competitive in everything. Maria and I were highly touted swimmers for the Gorky region, having won several district and regional competitions together, and we were now ranked high in the national statistics. She swam the fastest 100- and 200-meter backstroke I had ever seen. She was absolutely phenomenal. I swam the best freestyle and butterfly sprint events in our region. Competitive sports made a positive place for us within this unfamiliar society. Russia was a place where we felt free to excel. But today was not a competition; we planned a day of relaxation, a day to dream of the future, a day for fun. My best friend and I were going to play tennis.<br>Maria soon showed up, and we began to chitchat, volleying back and forth against the wall, talking and giggling about school and sports and, of course, boys. Our voices made a little rhythm with the tapping rackets, the bouncing tennis balls, and the warm summer wind rustling the leaves overhead. I remember thinking what an absolutely perfect day this was. It was about ten o&#x2019;clock. My papa was at work in the factory, Mama was at home doing her chores, and I planned to spend time with her later in the afternoon.<br>Mama was actually my best friend, and Maria came next. I always enjoyed the time I spent relaxing and talking with my mother, because she had an unassuming sort of tranquility about her that made you want to be around her. She had an inner peace and a silent strength that simply refused to be managed by outside circumstances. I counted on her for stability in the confusing world in which we lived. My mother&#x2019;s gaze drew you in with piercingly light blue, nearly violet eyes. But more than her eyes, it was her heart she was giving you. It was her spirit that always drew you in without effort. When she took my hand in hers, there were no more problems and no more worries. She made you feel that everything would be okay. And that was difficult here in Gorky, to be sure. My papa&#x2019;s work was hard, and for seven years we had been cut off from our American home. But my mama was something else. I always wanted to be just like her.<br>That summer day Maria and I were planning to play tennis for an hour or so, have a good workout, and then maybe go down to the river, the Oka, for a swim. Afterward I would come back home, help Mama with the chores, and wait for Papa to come home from work. We&#x2019;d have dinner together, I&#x2019;d bring him his pipe, and Mama would make him some coffee. Night after night we&#x2019;d sit and listen to him worry and complain about problems that agitated him so much at the factory, the things he could not change. My father was an idealist at heart, and change was part of his very nature. He was in constant torment about what he saw at work: the organizational, bureaucratic management &#x201c;nonsense,&#x201d; as he liked to say, in the factory. He would shake his head as he recounted the injustices he experienced at work, but then he would reassure us that a better day was coming, just ahead, on the horizon. &#x201c;Just wait. You&#x2019;ll see. It won&#x2019;t be like this forever. I promise,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d say, and I always believed him.<br>Sometimes he would read to me from one of our favorite books&#x2013;<i>Black Beauty </i>or <i>Treasure Island</i>&#x2013;and Mama would sit and smile, taking it all in. She enjoyed her family more than anything, and she was always trying to make life better for her husband. I had grown accustomed to these evenings. They were really no more complicated than that. We had made our own kind of adjustment to living in Russia, but beneath it all, I knew something was intrinsically wrong. I just didn&#x2019;t know how much.<br>Maria and I hit the tennis ball around and laughed hysterically about a boy named Boris, a Czech, from our high school. She was telling me about something crazy he did in class the day before, when she suddenly stopped in midsentence and almost dropped her racket. She stood as if paralyzed, looking past me toward my house. She whispered, &#x201c;Margo, a car just pulled up in front of your building... I thought I saw your father in it.&#x201d; My first thought was, <i>A car? Really? </i>I didn&#x2019;t understand why Papa would be home from work at this time, and I certainly didn&#x2019;t understand why he would be in a car or why a car would even be here. I was puzzled; automobiles were not a common sight in our village, except when there was trouble or something out of the ordinary. But I turned and saw the ominous-looking black sedan in front of our house, and then I saw its back door opening. I knew something was wrong&#x2013;terribly, terribly wrong. And I knew my papa was in the car. I stood there for a moment and stared, unable to move.<br>Maria looked at my face, threw her arms around my neck, and began to cry. &#x201c;Oh, Margo, not your father,&#x201d; she said in my ear. It was as if she already knew something I did not.<br>Maria was eighteen, going on thirty. Her mother had died under mysterious circumstances just a year earlier, and before that, her grandparents had been murdered during the Bolshevik Revolution. She was already more familiar with pain than I, and she carried a maturity beyond her years. They say, &#x201c;Whatever doesn&#x2019;t kill you will make you stronger.&#x201d; Maria, despite our relative closeness in age, was already stronger than I was.<br>A strange man in a dark gray uniform stepped out of the car first and then reached back inside to pull my father out by his arm. Running toward them, I screamed, &#x201c;Papa! Papa!&#x201d; I saw the man grab my father&#x2019;s wrist and force him around the car, where another man got out. He seized my father by his other wrist, and they pushed him toward the apartment. Papa didn&#x2019;t seem to struggle, at least not much. I thought that was odd. I remember a look of agony on his face, but he didn&#x2019;t appear to be struggling. What I recall seeing was the uncharacteristic resignation and absence of the fight that usually marked my father. That was strange to me, because he was a fighter&#x2013;innately a fighter! For a moment he didn&#x2019;t seem like my father, my flesh and blood. I wanted this to be any other man but him. But it was not. It was my papa. And I knew he hadn&#x2019;t done anything wrong, so I couldn&#x2019;t understand what was happening. I loved and admired my father, Carl Werner, more than I could ever describe. I thought he was what a man was all about and what a man should be. I compared every boy and every man I ever met to him. But what was happening here? Why were these men being so mean to him? My papa was foreman of the tool and die department at the Gorky automobile factory and a respected man. This couldn&#x2019;t be happening! I figured it was all a bad mistake&#x2013;a terrible mistake&#x2013;and certainly they would soon have this mess figured out, and things would be normal again. Of course, things in Gorky&#x2013;in Russia, for that matter&#x2013;were anything but normal.<br>About two years earlier, in 1936, Joseph Stalin had commenced infamous purges, instigated and carried out by his bloodthirsty associate Nikolai Yezhov and shortly thereafter by Lavrenti Beria, his notorious chief of the secret police. Beria was directly responsible for millions of deaths and unspeakable cruelty throughout Russia. The period in Soviet history known as the Bolshevik Revolution was over, but the Stalinist regime was at the height of its power and operating at full throttle. Throughout the land, it operated as a heartless killing machine, without conscience. In the period leading up to and during World War II, it took hundreds of thousands, even millions, of prisoners, often with no charges and no trials. You didn&#x2019;t have to be guilty of anything in Stalinist Russia to find yourself imprisoned or even killed. The Stalinist regime operated on paranoia, with no rational justification.<br>As my father was roughly pushed toward our building, he looked back over his shoulder, almost as if in confession, to see me running toward him. Then his face was shoved into the door by the two men. I was sprinting toward him but felt as if I was in slow motion, as if I would never get there. The other two men looked stone cold, without showing the slightest feeling or emotion, while my papa was being helplessly led to slaughter. How on earth could this be? The three of them disappeared through the building&#x2019;s front door as I raced just a few paces behind them, burning with fear and anguish. I flung open the normally cumbersome wooden door as if it were weightless. My heart was pounding right through my chest, and I was panting and crying. I ran up the narrow wooden stairway to see Papa just ahead of me, on the landing.<br>My papa, oh my dear papa! For the rest of my days, I will never forget his face as he turned to see me standing behind him. It was only a glance, but it was a look I had never seen before and one I wished I hadn&#x2019;t seen. I saw in his face the end&#x2013;the end of his innocently blind optimism and the end of his hopes for our life in this country that was not ours. That look bespoke hopelessness, utter despair, and death.<br>The look haunted me. Tears welled up in his eyes, and I knew that they were more for me than anything else. In a voice that struggled to be firm and reassuring, he said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t cry, my sweet girl. Everything will be all right.&#x201d; But his words were empty of faith. I knew at that moment he wanted me to believe his words, but his face told me he didn&#x2019;t believe them himself.<br>We knew something of Russia&#x2019;s brutality even to her own people, and yet my father always thought he could make a difference in this country. We had given up everything we had known in our beloved America and blindly left it all behind us when he brought us here. It was Papa&#x2019;s decision. And for what? During the hungry years of the Depression back home, he had actually pictured opportunity, livelihood, and financial stability in this country. That&#x2019;s why he came to Russia in the first place. That&#x2019;s why we came with him. That&#x2019;s why I was here. Didn&#x2019;t they know what our family had given up for Papa&#x2019;s commitment to this country, this Russia that was now stabbing him in the back as a &#x201c;reward&#x201d; for his faith?<br>The fear in his bewildered brown eyes drained them of all life. He quickly turned away, maybe ashamed that I had seen him that way. At that moment I knew this marked the end of his dream and the beginning of our nightmare. The two men who had arrested my father at work were from the NKVD. Under Stalin, the Soviet secret police had acquired vast punitive powers, and in 1934 the secret police were renamed the People&#x2019;s Commissariat for Internal Affairs, or NKVD. No longer subject to party control or restricted by law, the NKVD became a direct instrument for Stalin to use against the party and the country during the Great Terror of the 1930s. Now they had come to search our apartment.<br>My mind was racing, my heart pulsing uncontrollably. I didn&#x2019;t know what to do for him. This could not be happening; it just could not be happening! It had to be a mistake. My papa had done nothing wrong; I had to calm down. Once inside the apartment, I fumbled toward the kitchen, where I found some fresh strawberries from our garden. I poured some milk and sugar over them, and with feverishly shaking hands I tried to take them to Papa. I think at that moment they represented my love and much more. They represented everything I wanted to do for him but could not.<br>I was completely helpless.<br>I set the bowl down before him, and again our eyes met. &#x201c;Oh, Papa,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;how is this happening? Please tell me that everything is going to be all right...please, please, please!&#x201d;<br>He looked down at the floor, then at the bowl, then at me and over to Mama, and then back at the floor. He said nothing, but he cried silently, violently, from the innermost part of his being. My papa was shaking and looked as though he was barely breathing. He seemed afraid to look up, afraid of what we would see in his eyes. I was scared to death, mainly because I had never seen my papa so fragile and so completely helpless. As for the symbolic strawberries, he could not force down a single bite. We were all speechless and terrified.<br>Mama was told she could pack him a few necessary items, and she did s...</p><h2>Mountains Without Handrails: Reflections on the National Parks</h2><p><p> </p><p>Focusing on the long-standing and bitter battles over recreational use of our national parklands, Joseph L.

She'd marry, have kids, and then snap her body back into shape by doing Tae Bo. But she's celebrating her fortieth birthday as the maid of honor at her little sister's wedding...and still single. Now her life is suddenly complicated by the best man. He's the opposite of what she wants in a husband...and yet, he keeps defying her expectations. Starting with a lavendar rose--symbolizing enchantment--each rose he sends her reflects his growing love for her.</p><p>Cydney's best friend Dana appears to have the perfect marriage--until she discovers her husband's affair and her world goes into a tailspin.

How one chooses to behave sexually, Kim Cash Tate seems to be saying, directly relates to one&#39;s trust in God. And the strength of one&#39;s relationship with God directly relates to how one handles temptation and betrayal. Tate communicates the subtleties of married sexuality with taste and insight. ...Whether in life-stage, race, gender or occupation, there was a rich variety among the main characters and their guys. ...Tate avoids the unrealistic &#34;happily ever after&#34; ending while still offering a message of faith, hope, and love.

A city set on a hill cannot be hid. You cannot serve God and mammon. Judge not, that you be not judged</i>. Though such sayings from Jesus' Sermon on the Mount are very familiar, many people -- including Christians! -- struggle to fully understand and follow them. For those who are brave enough to reconsider what Jesus really said, Addison Hodges Hart offers <i>Taking Jesus at His Word</i>.</p><p>Addison Hodges Hart is a retired pastor and college chaplain.

Thanks to Addison Hodges Hart - whose writing is warm, real, and lilting -- the Sermon on the Mount comes alive as a veritable template to guide us through the twists and turns of our lives. This is a beautiful book, one that promises to be read over and over again.<br> -- Joan Chittister <br><br> "As ironic as it may seem, it's more popular these days to call Jesus 'Lord' than it is to strive to do what he taught. For all who want to follow Jesus' teachings, <i>Taking Jesus at His Word</i> is a beautiful gift. I'm grateful to Hart -- and more amazed than ever by Jesus."<br> -- Brian D. McLaren <br><br> "Addison Hart comes to the Sermon on the Mount seeking bedrock guidance from Jesus for the fundamental question facing all of us, Christian and non-Christian alike: How should I live my life? Hart's reflections provide thoughtful insights into these bracing teachings of Jesus. This isn't the last word on the Sermon, but it will help readers find for themselves Jesus' path of life."<br> -- Rodney A.

Like many girls of her day, she enjoys the fine clothes, food, and company of the elite social circles. But unlike her peers, Fanny is also drawn to education, literature, and more intellectual pursuits. Published author and poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow is also touring Europe, but under much different circumstances. Recently widowed, he is gathering research for a new publication that he hopes will secure his professorship at Harvard College. Befriended by the Appleton family while visiting Switzerland, Henry is introduced to Fanny and sees in her a kindred spirit, a lover of language and literature and high ideals. He is in love. Fanny, however, is uncertain. He is from a much lower social class and is older than she is. How could such a relationship ever thrive? Could a book of Henry&#39;s poetry, personally delivered, persuade Fanny to believe in a love that lasts forever and forever?</p><p>Josi S. Kilpack is the award-winning author of the Culinary Mystery series, and wrote two critically-acclaimed novels in <i>A Proper Romance series</i>: <i>A Heart Revealed</i> and <i>Lord Fenton's Folly</i>. She lives with her family in the Southwest.''Well-researched, emotionally charged tale based on the real courtship of Henry Longfellow, America s first professional poet, and Fanny Appleton, an intelligent Boston heiress. The relationship was rocky and unlikely...Henry maintains a friendship with Fanny's family, and his dogged pursuit of Fanny confuses her; the widower's ardent attentions don't jibe with her ideas about love that lasts forever. Henry's inner turmoil is absolutely heart-wrenching, as his continuing passion finds expression in his writing but meets resistance and even unkindness at times from Fanny and her friends. Kilpack vividly re-creates the era in which the couple lived and constructs a love story that even the pickiest poet would declare fit for the ages.'' --<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>''New romance series based on the actual courtships of renowned writers, artists and musicians. Kilpack richly describes the customs and mores of the time, while appealing to present day sensibilities. Readers will gain a very different understanding of Longfellow, both through the story, as he and Fanny marry and live together joyously until fate interrupts their ''happily ever after'' and through the accompanying materials, including an informative time line, interesting chapter notes, and useful discussion questions for book clubs. This is an unusual and thoroughly engaging and eye-opening approach to historical romance. The next in Kilpack's thoughtful series will feature Sir Walter Scott.'' -<i>Booklist</i> <br><p>''Absorbing love story that includes an impressive tour of Victorian Europe. The portraits of Fanny and Henry are superb, as is the rest of Fanny's family. The expectations of society are accurately portrayed.''<i>Romantic Times</i> (four star rating)<br> </p><p>''Based on biographies, letters and journals, fleshed out to provide a sketch of the life and times of an older widower and a young woman irresistibly drawn together...The question arises throughout the book - why would the daughter of a wealthy and respected Boston family even consider a man socially so far beneath her? The answer to this is provided in the frequent extended interior monologues, especially those of Fanny Appleton...Kilpack has included a few stanzas of Longfellow's love poems to ground the reader in his reality as he faces the long years of rejection. This book fills a void for readers of romantic historical novels while illustrating the issue of class in early 19th-century Boston society.'' --<i>-Historical Novel Society</i><br><br>''Absorbing love story that includes an impressive tour of Victorian Europe. The portraits of Fanny and Henry are superb, as is the rest of Fanny's family. The expectations of society are accurately portrayed.'' -<i>Romantic Times</i><br></p><p> ''A delightful story of love and second chances. Kilpack skillfully captures the time period, setting, and historical figures of the nineteenth century with graceful and articulate writing. Readers will appreciate the authenticity and intelligence of Henry and Fanny's relationship. Kilpack delves deep into the couple's complex courtship, and mixes the perfect amount of history with romance. The novel's chapter notes and timeline offer additional insight into Henry and Fanny's lives. Discussion questions make Forever and Forever a fantastic candidate for book club. Fans of romance and/or historical fiction will fall for this novel!'' --<i>Compass Book Ratings</i></p></p><h2>Village in the Vaucluse: Third Edition</h2><p>A comprehensive description of the culture of a small French rural community in the 1950&#39;s</p><p>Laurence William Wylie was Professor Emeritus in French Civilization at Harvard University.A moving, funny, acid and unforgettable scrutiny of the French seen up close.

Included are the humorous parodies of Phoebe Cary and Mary Weston Fordham and the stirring abolitionist poems of Lydia Sigourney, Frances Harper, Maria Lowell, and Rose Terry Cooke. Included, too, are haunting reflections on madness, drug use, and suicide of women whose lives, as Cheryl Walker explains, were often as melodramatic as the poems they composed and published. In addition to works by more than two dozen poets, the anthology includes ample headnotes about each author&#39;s life and a brief critical evaluation of her work. Walker&#39;s introduction to the volume provides valuable contextual material to help readers understand the cultural background, economic necessities, literary conventions, and personal dynamics that governed women&#39;s poetic production in the nineteenth century.</p><p>The Ideal <i>by Anne Charlotte Lynch Botta</i><br> The Ideal Found <i>by Anne Charlotte Lynch Botta</i><br> Lines; On An Incident Obseved From The Deck Of A Steamboat <i>by Anne Charlotte Lynch Botta</i><br> Lines; To One Who Wished To Read A Poem I Had Written <i>by Anne Charlotte Lynch Botta</i><br> Love <i>by Anne Charlotte Lynch Botta</i><br> Milton <i>by Anne Charlotte Lynch Botta</i><br> Tarpeia <i>by Anne Charlotte Lynch Botta</i><br> To An Astronomer <i>by Anne Charlotte Lynch Botta</i><br> To Elizabeth Barrett Browning <i>by Anne Charlotte Lynch Botta</i><br> The Wounded Vulture <i>by Anne Charlotte Lynch Botta</i><br> Canto 2.

The selections reveal a wide range of themes: slavery and abolition; doubt and religious consolation; insanity and consumption; female education and equal access; opium and alcoholism; the plight of Native Americans; tributes to Lincoln and freedom; and love, sanctuary, hardship, and secret sorrow. Walker provides a long introduction on the period and evaluative author notes, which are helpful since most writers will not be familiar. Though contemporary poems differ noticeably in form from those found here, readers will find numerous good poems with more than historical interest. For those who believe literary canons need reconstruction, this new anthology will be welcome.<br><i>- Addie Lee Bracy, formerly with Beaver Coll.

Barnum is the greatest showman the world has ever seen. As a creator of the Barnum &amp; Baily Circus and a champion of wonder, joy, trickery, and &#x201c;humbug,&#x201d; he was the founding father of American entertainment&#x2014;and as Robert Wilson argues, one of the most important figures in American history.<br> <br>Nearly 125 years after his death, the name P.T. Barnum still inspires wonder. Robert Wilson&#x2019;s vivid new biography captures the full genius, infamy, and allure of the ebullient showman, who, from birth to death, repeatedly reinvented himself. He learned as a young man how to wow crowds, and built a fortune that placed him among the first millionaires in the United States. He also suffered tragedy, bankruptcy, and fires that destroyed his life&#x2019;s work, yet willed himself to recover and succeed again. As an entertainer, Barnum courted controversy throughout his life&#x2014;yet he was also a man of strong convictions, guided in his work not by a desire to deceive, but an eagerness to thrill and bring joy to his audiences. He almost certainly never uttered the infamous line, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a sucker born every minute,&#x201d; instead taking pride in giving crowds their money&#x2019;s worth and more.<br> <br>Robert Wilson, editor of <i>The American Scholar</i>, tells a gripping story in <i>Barnum</i>, one that&#x2019;s imbued with the same buoyant spirit as the man himself. In this &#x201c;engaging, insightful, and richly researched new biography&#x201d; (<i>New York Journal of Books</i>), Wilson adeptly makes the case for P.T. Barnum&#x2019;s place among the icons of American history, as a figure who represented, and indeed created, a distinctly American sense of optimism, industriousness, humor, and relentless energy.</p><p>Robert Wilson has been an award-winning editor at&nbsp;<i>Preservation,</i>&nbsp;<i>Civilization</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The American Scholar</i>, which he has edited since 2004.

He represents the enterprise and energy of his countrymen in the nineteenth century, as Washington represented their resistance to oppression in the century preceding.<br> <br>&#x2014;John Delaware Lewis, Across the Atlantic, 1851<br> <br>In 1842, the man who would become America&#x2019;s greatest showman received a visit from a museum owner in Boston who needed his help. Moses Kimball had made his way to P. T. Barnum&#x2019;s office in New York City with a box that, he baldly claimed, contained the remains of a mermaid. When the box was opened and the object was unwrapped, what Barnum saw was a shrunken, blackish thing about three feet long that seemed pretty obviously to be the head and torso of a monkey joined to the lower portion of a large fish. Kimball had a story to go with this desiccated corpse, something about its being discovered by sailors in the South Seas, but he had no idea what to do with it. Although the two men had not previously met, their establishments had collaborated on several acts and exhibitions. Barnum had recently acquired a dusty old museum on lower Broadway, dubbed it the American Museum, and dedicated it to natural history, art and artifacts, performances, and an exuberant miscellany of anything that caught his eye. The growing renown of the new museum, along with Barnum&#x2019;s already established reputation as an impresario with a knack for publicity, made him a logical person for Kimball to go to for advice.1<br> <br>While Kimball wondered what could be done with this grotesque specimen&#x2014;so different from the beautiful mythological beings that people had imagined for centuries&#x2014;Barnum didn&#x2019;t hesitate. He offered to lease the object from Kimball and present it to the public himself. After giving the creature an exotic name&#x2014;the Fejee Mermaid&#x2014;he created a bold strategy to conjure up a storm of interest in it.<br> <br>Within days Barnum was executing a complicated plan to acquire free publicity from the press. He sent letters to friends in cities in the South, all telling a made-up story about a British naturalist who had acquired the mermaid in the Fiji Islands and was stopping in New York on his way to London, where it would be put on display. This naturalist was supposedly passing through the South, and every few days a friend from a different southern city would mail one of Barnum&#x2019;s letters, which were written as news reports of local happenings, to a different New York newspaper. While he was whetting the appetite of the press, Barnum had posters made of beautiful, bare-breasted mermaids with long blond curls, implying that this was what the Fejee Mermaid had once looked like. By the time the supposed naturalist reached New York, the press was in a frenzy, and Barnum gave three different newspapers an unsigned report that he had written defending the existence of mermaids, along with an idealized image in woodcut, suitable for printing. Each of the newspapers was promised an exclusive, and it was only when all three published the story on the same Sunday morning that they knew they had been hoodwinked. If the editors were miffed, they didn&#x2019;t show it by withholding coverage of the exhibit. After all, Barnum was a steady advertiser, and this new exhibit would mean new ads each day in their newspapers.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s safe to say that most people who came to see the Fejee Mermaid and hear the ersatz naturalist talk about it were not taken in. But Barnum&#x2019;s early publicity drew huge crowds to the display, and even if they doubted that this shriveled specimen had ever been the lovely, storied creature in the posters, still it was a thing worth seeing and judging for themselves. Whatever the skepticism of his patrons, the showman didn&#x2019;t let up in the weeks that followed. With a steady stream of ads, often warning that the display would soon be leaving for London, augmented by a barrage of pamphlets and posters, he kept the customers coming. When the flow of visitors finally slowed, he sent the Fejee Mermaid out on the road. His plan, which had come to him in an instant when he first saw the specimen, had worked to perfection.<br> <br>Later in life, Barnum would confess that he was not proud of this exhibit, but even then he could not resist exulting in the success of his publicity scheme. The Fejee Mermaid was characteristic of Barnum&#x2019;s exhibitions during his early years; even as a young man he had an unfailing sense of what the public wanted, yet he could be brazenly manipulative and unafraid of controversy. These qualities made him successful as a showman, but they also made it possible for him to push too far. When, for instance, he had put on tour an elderly slave woman who claimed to be the 161-year-old former nursemaid to George Washington, the newspapers and other guardians of public virtue howled, condemning him for exploiting her. At other times, Barnum drew criticism less for his actions than for his attitude. When he published the first version of his autobiography, in 1855, detailing his many humbugs and the riches they had afforded him, some reviewers were disgusted not so much by the original sins but by his seeming pride in admitting to them. He was often seen as a man who would do anything for a buck, and by the time he was middle-aged, the quip &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Barnum?&#x201d; was applied to any novelty, discovery, or invention of the day, under the assumption that he would soon show up to add it to his museum collection.<br> <br>The missteps of Barnum&#x2019;s early career would ultimately damage his reputation in a lasting way. Well after his death in 1891, his image in the public mind congealed around another phrase, this one attributed to Barnum himself: &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a sucker born every minute.&#x201d; The cynical saying implies that he was no better than a huckster, whose chief goal was using fast talk to trick people out of their money while giving them nothing in return. Even to this day, these words serve as shorthand for Barnum&#x2019;s philosophy as a showman, but no evidence exists that he ever spoke or wrote them. What&#x2019;s worse, they utterly misrepresent the man as he really was.<br> <br>The actual arc of Barnum&#x2019;s life is much more interesting, and much more consequential, than his present-day reputation suggests. He may have begun his career as a promoter of sketchy acts in a business that was often considered less than respectable, but he changed both himself and the business over the decades, earning the respect of Americans of every station. Because he had so determinedly placed himself in the public eye, people knew all about his early missteps as well as his successes&#x2014;his &#x201c;struggles and triumphs,&#x201d; as the title of a later version of his autobiography puts it. He didn&#x2019;t hesitate to show his flaws, but he would also reveal in time that he was that rare thing, a man who was steered by his ideals, becoming a better person as he navigated a long lifetime. Over many years, Barnum became a steady, civic-minded, fun-loving man who cultivated a close relationship with his audience and embodied many of the best aspects of the American character. He eventually won over the public with his unflagging energy, his wit and buoyant good humor, his patriotic zeal for the Union side in the Civil War, and his commitment to charitable causes, good government, and his Universalist faith.<br> <br>He is known today primarily for his connection to the circus, but that came only in the last quarter of his long life. His principal occupations before that were running the American Museum and being the impresario behind the witty and talented dwarf Tom Thumb, the angelic Swedish soprano Jenny Lind&#x2014;who created a sensation in America in the early 1850s&#x2014;and dozens of other acts and traveling shows. Less well known today is that he was also a best-selling author, an inspirational lecturer on temperance and on success in business and in life, a real-estate developer, a builder, a banker, a state legislator, and the mayor of the city of Bridgeport, Connecticut, near or in which he lived for most of his adult life. He was even a candidate for Congress, losing a bare-knuckle contest to a cousin also named Barnum. In all of these endeavors he was a promoter and self-promoter without peer, a relentless advertiser and an unfailingly imaginative concoctor of events or exhibits to draw the interest, often the feverish interest, of potential patrons.<br> <br>Throughout his life, Barnum worked steadily to transform the image of public entertainment in America. In the long middle of his career, his American Museum included what he called a Lecture Room, where, in addition to lectures, both dramas and melodramas were presented. At the time, theaters were not considered morally or even physically safe places for children and families. Prostitutes often plied their trade in the balconies, and sobriety was not much in evidence even in the orchestra seats. But Barnum enforced an environment in both the museum and the Lecture Room that was free of drunkenness, improper behavior, and anything else that could give offense to people whose scruples might otherwise keep them away. He emphasized the moral quality of his dramas and the safety of his exhibit spaces, ensuring that customers of all ages could enjoy them. Later he and his partner James A. Bailey brought this same commitment to the rough-and-tumble world of the traveling circus, presenting entertainment that even Barnum&#x2019;s many preacher friends could defend, in a setting that was appropriate for families and children.<br> <br>By the end of his life, he was admired and respected not only in the United States but also across much of the globe. When the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, immodestly but accurately called The Greatest Show on Earth, traveled through the American heartland in the 1880s, Barnum would often go out to meet the show and thereby boost its attendance numbers. Rural circus-goers took special trains put on to carry them to the cities where the traveling extravaganza typically stopped. The reason for these excursions, on what were known as &#x201c;Barnum days,&#x201d; was often to see the showman as much as the show. He had become as close to a global celebrity as a person could be at the time. After Ulysses S. Grant&#x2019;s second term as president, the great general made a two-year tour of the world, promoting the United States. Upon his return, Barnum said to him, &#x201c;General, I think you are the best known American living,&#x201d; to which Grant replied, &#x201c;By no means. You beat me sky-high, for wherever I went . . . the constant inquiry was, &#x2018;Do you know Barnum?&#x2019;?&#x201d;2<br> <br>CENTRAL TO BARNUM&#x2019;S PHILOSOPHY AND success was the relationship to his audience that he developed during his decades as a showman. That relationship centered on the single word most associated with Barnum in his lifetime: humbug. As he himself wrote in his 1865 book, The Humbugs of the World, Webster&#x2019;s definition is &#x201c;to deceive; to impose on.&#x201d; Definitions today include the words hoax, fraud, impostor, nonsense, trick. Barnum&#x2019;s book is a survey of such practices, intended, he said, to save the rising generation from being bamboozled by the unscrupulous, whether in religion, business, politics, medicine, or science. But for Barnum, not all forms of humbug were hurtful; sometimes humbuggery could be harmless, even joyous. He claimed that, for him, the &#x201c;generally accepted definition&#x201d; of humbug focused on this benign variety, what he defined as &#x201c;putting on glittering appearances . . . novel expedients, by which to suddenly arrest public attention, and attract the public eye and ear.&#x201d; In other words, what he did. The crux of the matter was that a person who attracted patrons in this way but then &#x201c;foolishly fails to give them a full equivalent for their money,&#x201d; would not get a second chance from customers who would &#x201c;properly denounce him as a swindler, a cheat, an impostor.&#x201d;3<br> <br>So for Barnum, who sometimes called himself the &#x201c;Prince of Humbugs,&#x201d; humbuggery was a mildly deceitful way to get people in the door, but its harmlessness depended entirely on how satisfied they were once inside. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe in &#x2018;duping the public,&#x2019;?&#x201d; he wrote in a letter in 1860, &#x201c;but I believe in first attracting &amp; then pleasing them.&#x201d; For many years, he charged only a quarter, half that for children, to visit his museum and see his shows there, while he tirelessly searched the globe for more and better acts, exhibits, and curiosities, and spent freely on them to reward that small investment by his patrons. People might be drawn in to see the human curiosities he exhibited, the giants and little people of both sexes, the bearded ladies, fat children, and stick-like men, the albinos, American Indians, Chinese princesses, Siamese twins, and the What Is It?&#x2014;an exhibit presented as the possible missing link between beast and man suggested by Darwin&#x2019;s recent book about evolution. But once inside his museum, they would be exposed to what he advertised as a million objects. In a period when public education, photography, the telegraph, the railroad, and the newspaper were all making the world a smaller and more knowable place, people flocked to Barnum&#x2019;s museum, and when he took displays to other cities, he rarely failed to draw big crowds.4<br> <br>As a businessman, Barnum never apologized for making vast amounts of money, but he did believe that his museum offered his patrons the chance to learn. And if a little trickery&#x2014;such as turning a hideous, shrunken thing into an alluring mermaid from the South Pacific&#x2014;was needed to get people to view the serious exhibits, then, he came to believe, they should be in on the trick. He would often hint at the dubiousness of his latest sensation, even promoting his skeptics&#x2019; views, and then challenge his audience to judge for themselves. This strategy was good for business if people were moved to go back for a second look, paying a second quarter, but it also recognized the need his customers felt to exercise their own critical skills. He generally approached them with a knowing wink so they could be part of the fun. &#x201c;Good old Barnum,&#x201d; they would say with affection upon figuring out what they were seeing. He entertained but also stimulated them, making them feel excited about their growing understanding of the world beyond the rural homestead, the isolated village, or the crowded urban neighborhood.<br> <br>The nineteenth century was a time of rapid democratization in both the United States and Europe, as the old monarchical and aristocratic structures and the barriers of class came tumbling down. Barnum, who was born ten years into the century and died nine years before its end, embodied the period&#x2019;s great narrative of breaking social boundaries. Americans often saw him as an exemplar of what it meant to be one of them, and the Europeans he encountered on his many trips abroad also saw him as a representative of the American character. He was born into a family that had to hustle in its small Connecticut village to stay solvent. Through hard work, a lot of brass, and a genius for exploiting the new technologies related to communication and transportation, he became world famous and wealthy beyond his dreams. And he did it all by appealing to popular tastes and interests. He understood what ordinary Americans wanted, as they sought forms of entertainment beyond staring into the fire of an evening or listening to readings from the Bible after the family supper.5<br> <br>We live in an ahistorical age, one that is quick to condemn historical figures using the standards of the present.

The delivery of the ill-gotten volume, however, is a different story. Drugged by the client's female go-between, Bernie wakes up in her apartment to find the book gone, the lady dead, a smoking gun in his hand, and the cops at the door. And suddenly he's got to extricate himself from a rather sticky real-life murder mystery and find a killer -- before he's booked for Murder One.</p></p><p><p>Lawrence Block is one of the most widely recognized names in the mystery genre.

The loveable guy, who is an antiquarian bookseller by day and a sometimes burglar at night, makes his fifth appearance on audio with this reading by his creator, mystery writer Lawrence Block. As with all the Bernie audiobooks, the plot matters little. Bernie pilfers an item�in this case, a rare edition of a Kipling book once owned by a well-known person (who shall remain nameless so as not to spoil the fun)�and ends up being charged with murder. After the first three sides, Bernie, wryly performed by Block with the perfect New York accent, rounds up all the suspects. This is the fourth Burglar book Block has read. In a brief interview the author explained that he records his own books &#34;because I&#39;m a ham. I enjoy doing readings on promotional tours.&#34; Block also explained that he doesn&#39;t write the condensed versions but touches them up before the recordings are made. As to how much of Bernie is really Block himself, the author said, &#34;Not too much. I haven&#39;t knocked off any apartments lately.&#34; What&#39;s up next for Bernie? Block would only reveal that in the next book &#34;Bernie leaves the city and winds up in a country house outside New York.&#34; S.I.R.

[Paperback] [Apr 06, 2017] Lewis Hyde</h2><p>Trickster Makes This World</p><p>Lewis Hyde was born in Boston and studied at the Universities of Minnesota and Iowa. In addition to Trickster Makes This World, he is the author of The Gift, a defence of the importance of creativity in our increasingly money-orientated society. A MacArthur Fellow and former Director of Creative Writing at Harvard, Hyde is currently the Professor of Creative Writing at Kenyon College in Ohio.Trickster Makes This World<br>PART ONETRAP OF NATURE1SLIPPING THE TRAP OF APPETITE<i>The whitebait</i> <i>Opens its black eyes</i> <i>In the net of the Law.</i>--<i>Basho</i>THE BAIT THIEFThe trickster myth derives creative intelligence from appetite. It begins with a being whose main concern is getting fed and it ends with the same being grown mentally swift, adept at creating and unmasking deceit, proficient at hiding his tracks and at seeing through the devices used by others to hide theirs. Trickster starts out hungry, but before long he is master of the kind of creative deception that, according to a long tradition, is a prerequisite of art. Aristotle wrote that Homer first "taught the rest of us the art of framing lies the right way." Homer makes lies seem so real that they enter the world and walk among us. Odysseus walks among us to this day, and he would seem to be Homer's own self-portrait, for Odysseus, too, is a master of the art of lying, an art he got from his grandfather, Autolycus, who got it in turn from <i>his</i> father, Hermes. And Hermes, in an old story we shall soon consider, invented lying when he was a hungry child with a hankering for meat.But I'm making a straight line out of a narrative that twists and turns,and I'm getting ahead of myself. We must begin at the beginning, with trickster learning how to keep his stomach full.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Trickster stories, even when they clearly have much more complicated cultural meanings, preserve a set of images from the days when what mattered above all else was hunting. At one point in the old Norse tales, the mischief-maker Loki has made the other gods so angry that he has to flee and go into hiding. In the mountains, he builds himself a house with doors on all sides so he can watch the four horizons. To amuse himself by day, he changes into a salmon, swimming the mountain streams, leaping the waterfalls. Sitting by the fire one morning, trying to imagine how the others might possibly capture him, he takes linen string and twists it into a mesh in the way that fishnets have been made ever since. Just at that moment, the others approach. Loki throws the net into the fire, changes into a salmon, and swims away. But the gods find the ashes of his net and from their pattern deduce the shape of the device they need to make. In this way, Loki is finally captured.It makes a nice emblem of trickster's ambiguous talents, Loki imagining that first fishnet and then getting caught in it. Moreover, the device in question is a central trickster invention. In Native American creation stories, when Coyote teaches humans how to catch salmon, he makes the first fish weir out of logs and branches. On the North Pacific coast, the trickster Raven made the first fishhook; he taught the spider how to make her web and human beings how to make nets. The history of trickery in Greece goes back to similar origins. "Trick" is <i>d�los</i> in Homeric Greek, and the oldest known use of the term refers to a quite specific trick: baiting a hook to catch a fish.East and west, north and south, this is the oldest trick in the book. No trickster has ever been credited with inventing a potato peeler, a gas meter, a catechism, or a tuning fork, but trickster invents the fish trap.Coyote was going along by a big river when he got very hungry. He built a trap of poplar poles and willow branches and set it in the water. "Salmon!" he called out. "Come into this trap." Soon a big salmon came along and swam into the chute of the trap and then flopped himself out on the bank where Coyote clubbed himto death. "I will find a nice place in the shade and broil this up," thought Coyote.Trickster commonly relies on his prey to help him spring the traps he makes. In this fragment of a Nez Perc� story from northeastern Idaho, Coyote's salmon weir takes advantage of forces the salmon themselves provide. Salmon in a river are swimming upstream to spawn; sexual appetite or instinct gives them a particular trajectory and Coyote works with it. Even with a baited hook, the victim's hunger is the <i>moving</i> part. The worm just sits there; the fish catches himself. Likewise, in a Crow story from the Western Plains, Coyote traps two buffalo by stampeding them into the sun so they cannot see where they are going, then leading them over a cliff. The fleetness of large herbivores is part of their natural defense against predators; Coyote (or the Native Americans who slaughtered buffalo in this way) takes advantage of that instinctual defense by directing the beasts into the sun and toward a cliff, so that fleetness itself backfires. In the invention of traps, trickster is a technician of appetite and a technician of instinct.And yet, as the Loki story indicates, trickster can also get snared in his own devices. Trickster is at once culture hero and fool, clever predator and stupid prey. Hungry, trickster sometimes devises stratagems to catch his meal; hungry, he sometimes loses his wits altogether. An Apache story from Texas, in which Rabbit has played a series of tricks on Coyote, ends as follows:Rabbit came to a field of watermelons. In the middle of the field there was a stick figure made of gum. Rabbit hit it with his foot and got stuck. He got his other foot stuck, then one hand and then his other hand and finally his head. This is how Coyote found him."What are you doing like this?" asked Coyote."The farmer who owns this melon patch was mad because I would not eat melons with him. He stuck me on here and said that in a while he would make me eat chicken with him. I told him I wouldn't do it.""You are foolish. I will take your place."Coyote pulled Rabbit free and stuck himself up in the gumtrap. When the farmer who owned the melons came out and saw Coyote he shot him full of holes.Coyote doesn't just get stuck in gum traps, either; in other stories, a range of animals--usually sly cousins such as Fox or Rabbit or Spider--make a fool of him and steal his meat.So trickster is cunning about traps but not so cunning as to avoid them himself. To my mind, then, the myth contains a story about the incremental creation of an intelligence about hunting. Coyote can imagine the fish trap precisely because he's been a fish himself, as it were. Nothing counters cunning but more cunning. Coyote's wits are sharp precisely because he has met other wits, just as the country bumpkin may eventually become a cosmopolitan if enough confidence men appear to school him.Some recent ideas in evolutionary theory echo these assertions. In <i>Evolution of the Brain and Intelligence</i>, Harry Jerison presents a striking chart showing the relative intelligence of meat-eaters and the herbivores they prey on. Taking the ratio of brain to body size as a crude index, Jerison finds that if we compare herbivores and carnivores at any particular moment in history the predators are always slightly brainier than the prey. But the relationship is never stable; there is a slow step-by-step increase in intelligence on both sides. If we chart the brain-body ratio on a scale of 1 to 10, in the archaic age herbivores get a 2 and carnivores a 4; thirty million years later the herbivores are up to 4 but the carnivores have gone up to 6; another thirty million years and the herbivores are up to 6 but the carnivores are up to 8; finally, when the herbivores get up to 9, the carnivores are up to 10. The hunter is always slightly smarter, but the prey is always wising up. In evolutionary theory, the tension between predator and prey is one of the great engines that has driven the creation of intelligence itself, each side successively and ceaselessly responding to the other.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>If this myth contains a story about incrementally increasing intelligence, where does it lead? What happens after the carnivore gets up to 10?There is a great deal of folklore about coyotes in the American West. One story has it that in the old days sheep farmers tried to get rid ofwolves and coyotes by putting out animal carcasses laced with strychnine. The wolves, they say, were killed in great numbers, but the coyotes wised up and avoided these traps. Another story has it that when trappers set metal leg traps they will catch muskrat and mink and fox and skunk, but coyote only rarely. Coyotes develop their own relationship to the trap; as one naturalist has written, "it is difficult to escape the conclusion that coyotes ... have a sense of humor. How else to explain, for instance, the well-known propensity of experienced coyotes to dig up traps, turn them over, and urinate or defecate on them?"With this image we move into a third relationship between tricksters and traps. When a coyote defecates on a trap he is neither predator nor prey but some third thing. A fragment of a native Tlingit story from Alaska will help us name that thing:[Raven] came to a place where many people were encamped fishing ... . He entered a house and asked what they used for bait. They said, "Fat." Then he said, "Let me see you put enough on your hooks for bait," and he noticed carefully how they baited and handled their hooks. The next time they went out, he walked off behind a point and went underwater to get this bait. Now they got bites and pulled up quickly, but there was nothing on their hooks.Raven eventually gets in trouble for this little trick (the fishermen steal his beak and he has to pull an elaborate return-ruse to get it back), but for now the point is simply that in the relationship between fish and fishermen this trickster stands to the side and takes on a third role.A similar motif appears in Africa with the Zulu trickster known as Thl�kunyana. Thl�kunyana is imagined to be a small man, "the size of a weasel," and in fact one of his other names also refers to a red weasel with a black-tipped tail. A Zulu storyteller describes this animal ascleverer than all others, for its cunning is great. If a trap is set for a wild cat, [the weasel] comes immediately to the trap, and takes away the mouse which is placed there for the cat: it takes it out first; and when the cat comes the mouse has been already eaten by the weasel.If a hunter does manage to trap this tricky weasel, he will have bad luck. A kind of jinx or magical influence remains in the trap that has caught a weasel and that influence forever after "stands in the way" of the trap's power; it will no longer catch game.Coyote in fact and folklore, Raven and Thl�kunyana in mythology--in each of these cases, trickster gets wise to the bait and is therefore all the harder to catch. The coyote who avoids a strychnined carcass is perhaps the simplest case; he does not get poisoned but he also gets nothing to eat. Raven and Thl�kunyana are more cunning in this regard; they are bait-thief tricksters who separate the trap from the meat and eat the meat. Each of these tales has a predator-prey relationship in it--the fish and the fishermen, for example--but the bait thief doesn't enter directly into that oppositional eating game. A parasite or epizoon, he feeds his belly while standing just outside the conflict between hunter and hunted. From that position the bait thief becomes a kind of critic of the usual rules of the eating game and as such subverts them, so that traps he has visited lose their influence. What trapper's pride could remain unshaken once he's read Coyote's commentary?In all these stories, trickster must do more than feed his belly; he must do so without himself getting eaten. Trickster's intelligence springs from appetite in two ways; it simultaneously seeks to satiate hunger and to subvert all hunger not its own. This last is an important theme. In the Okanagon creation story, the Great Spirit, having told Coyote that he must show the New People how to catch salmon, goes on to say: "I have important work for you to do ... There are many bad creatures on earth. You will have to kill them, otherwise they will eat the New People. When you do this, the New People will honor you ... They will honor you for killing the People-devouring monsters and for teaching ... all the ways of living." In North America, trickster stepped in to defeat the monsters who used to feed on humans.The myth says, then, that there are large, devouring forces in this world, and that trickster's intelligence arose not just to feed himself but to outwit these other eaters. Typically, this meeting is oppositional--the prey outwitting the predator. The bait thief suggests a different, non-oppositional strategy. Here trickster feeds himself where predator and prey meet, but rather than entering the game on their terms he plays with its rules. Perhaps, then, another force behind trickster's cunning is the desire to remove himself from the eating game altogether, or at least seehow far out he can get and still feed his belly (for if he were to stop eating entirely he would no longer be trickster).EATING THE ORGANS OF APPETITE<i>What god requires a sacrifice of every man, woman, and child three times a day?</i><i>--Yoruba riddle</i>Not many stories purport to explain the origins of appetite, but one may be found at the beginning of the Tsimshian Raven cycle from the North Pacific coast. A desire to escape the trap of appetite, and some limit to that desire, organizes "Raven Becomes Voracious."&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It seems that the whole world was once covered with darkness. On the Queen Charlotte Islands there was a town in which the animals lived. An animal chief and his wife lived there with their only child, a boy whom they loved very much. The father tried to keep his son from all danger. He built the boy a bed above his own in the rear of his large house. He washed him regularly, and the boy grew to be a young man.When he was quite large, this youth became ill, and before long, he died. His parents wept and wept. The animal chief invited the tribe to his house. When they had assembled, he ordered the youth's body to be laid out. "Take out his intestines," he said. His attendants laid out the youth's body, removed the intestines, burned them at the rear of the house, and placed the body on the bed which the father had built for his son. Under the corpse of their dead son, the chief and the chieftainess wailed every morning, and the tribe wailed with them.One morning before daylight, when the chieftainess went to mourn, she looked up and saw a young man, bright as fire, lying where the body of her son had lain. She called to her husband, who climbed the ladder and said, "Is it you, my beloved son? Is it you?" "Yes, it is I," said the shining youth, and his parents' hearts were filled with gladness.When the tribe came to console their chief and chieftainess, they were surprised to see the shining youth. He spoke to them. "Heaven was much annoyed by your constant wailing, so He sent me down to comfortyour minds." Everyone was very glad the prince lived among them again; his parents loved him more than ever.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The chief had two great slaves--a miserable man and his wife. The great slaves were called Mouth at Each End. Every morning they brought all kinds of food into the house. Every time they came back from hunting, they brought a large cut of whale meat with them, threw it on the fire, and ate it.The shining youth ate very little. Days went by. He chewed a little fat, bu...</p><h2>Murder in All Honour: A Doyle and Acton Mystery (The Doyle &amp; Acton Mystery Series)</h2><p>Things are a bit grim at Scotland Yard, this Christmas.

Population growth has been slowing for two generations. The world&#x2019;s population will peak, and then begin shrinking, within the next fifty years. In some countries, it&#x2019;s already started. Japan, for instance, will be half its current size by the end of the century. In Italy, there are already more deaths than births every year.

During this brief period, we encounter a broad vista of scriptural surprises. For example, we discover that during the crisis connected with the last week in the Savior's life, all of the apostles lost their testimonies. Jesus knew this would happen, and at the Last Supper He told Peter that when he was reconverted he should strengthen his brethren. It seems very strange that in spite of all the Savior's marvelous miracles, His half-brothers rejected Him during His ministry; however, in the end, they all accepted Jesus as their Savior and one of them became an apostle.<br><br>Students of the scriptures recognize the New Testament as one of the greatest scriptures ever written, but even those who have read it a number of times may still find a great many new and exciting treasures of inspiration and knowledge as this second volume unfolds.</p><p></p><h2>The Seedling Quilts: 11 English Paper Pieced and Appliqu�d Panels Inspired by Medical Herbs</h2><p>Made of 11 English Paper Pieced and appliqued panels inspired by medicinal herbs, Seedlings Quilt is a stitchy journey through an ancient herb garden.

Including such divergent topics as landscape art, ocean ecologies, and plastic activism, Alaimo explores our environmental predicaments to better understand feminist occupations of transcorporeal subjectivity.</p><p>She puts scientists, activists, artists, writers, and theorists in conversation, revealing that the state of the planet in the twenty-first century has radically transformed ethics, politics, and what it means to be human. Ultimately, <i>Exposed</i> calls for an environmental stance in which, rather than operating from an externalized perspective, we think, feel, and act as the very stuff of the world.</p></p><p><p>Stacy Alaimo is professor of English and director of the environmental and sustainability studies minor at the University of Texas at Arlington.

Jack Halberstam, University of Southern California</p><br><br><p>"Despite the gravity of her subject matter, Alaimo&#x2019;s examples and writing are often playful. This not only echoes the complexity and occasional contradictions of environmental politics but also makes <i>Exposed</i> a very enjoyable read.

Five years later they meet again when his sister and mother come for a design consultation.

Catherine desires above all else to see her father set free--even at the cost of her own dreams.

Bush, Americans have long sought to integrate faith with politics. Few have been as successful as Hollywood evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson.</p><p>During the years between the two world wars, McPherson was the most flamboyant and controversial minister in the United States. She built an enormously successful and innovative megachurch, established a mass media empire, and produced spellbinding theatrical sermons that rivaled Tinseltown's spectacular shows. As McPherson's power grew, she moved beyond religion into the realm of politics, launching a national crusade to fight the teaching of evolution in the schools, defend Prohibition, and resurrect what she believed was the United States' Christian heritage. Convinced that the antichrist was working to destroy the nation's Protestant foundations, she and her allies saw themselves as a besieged minority called by God to join the "old time religion" to American patriotism. </p><p>Matthew Sutton's definitive study of Aimee Semple McPherson reveals the woman, most often remembered as the hypocritical vamp in Sinclair Lewis's <i>Elmer Gantry</i>, as a trail-blazing pioneer. Her life marked the beginning of Pentecostalism's advance from the margins of Protestantism to the mainstream of American culture. Indeed, from her location in Hollywood, McPherson's integration of politics with faith set precedents for the religious right, while her celebrity status, use of spectacle, and mass media savvy came to define modern evangelicalism.</p></p><p>Matthew Avery Sutton is Associate Professor of History at Washington State University.&#x201c;Matthew Sutton's <i>Aimee Semple McPherson</i> may be the best single book yet published on this icon of early twentieth-century American religion and culture. Beautifully paced and superbly researched, the book weaves McPherson's inherently fascinating and ultimately tragic career into larger stories about California, pentecostalism, and emerging popular culture. Empathetic, critical, and insightful simultaneously, Sutton has produced a compellingly narrated book about one of modern America's most magnetic women.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jon Butler, author of <i>Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;At long last, a biographical exploration of Aimee Semple McPherson that steers clear of stereotype, caricature, and condescension. Matthew Sutton deftly addresses Sister Aimee's fame and her legacy in his fine biography, but he does so with care and attention to her humanity as well.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>William Deverell, University of Southern California</b><br><br>&#x201c;Aimee Semple McPherson passionately embraced her role as a religious celebrity in an increasingly mass media-oriented age and steadfastly refused to be constrained by traditional notions of gender or sexuality. Americans of the 1920s and 1930s were fascinated by her, and readers today will feel the same way, thanks to Matthew Avery Sutton's timely and absorbing biography.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Susan Ware, editor of <i>Notable American Women: Completing the Twentieth Century</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Not content to see Aimee Semple McPherson--"Sister"--simply as a woman evangelist, or even as a religious icon, Matthew Sutton places her career in a wide range of contexts, including gender, media, Southern California popular culture, and the muscular expansion of American evangelicalism. This is terrific history, reflecting meticulous research, persuasive argumentation, and a writing style as vibrant as the story it tells.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Grant Wacker, author of <i>Heaven Below: Early Pentecostals and American Culture</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In the page-turning book, <i>Aimee Semple McPherson and the Resurrection of Christian America</i>, Matthew Avery Sutton makes a persuasive case that the Canadian evangelist was responsible for rescuing conservative Protestantism from obscurity while creating the political model for today's powerful Religious Right. She promoted the now-widely held conviction that Jesus Christ and the 'American way of life' are synonymous. Other books have been written about McPherson, but Sutton's goes furthest in making the important argument that the Canadian evangelist was the most influential model for the merging of conservative Christian identity and American patriotism...At the time of the 1925 Scopes 'monkey trial' over the teaching of evolution, McPherson organized a giant parade and theatrical stage play at her baroque Angelus Temple that portrayed what she called the 'hanging and burial of monkey teachers.' Eighty years later, McPherson's brand of evangelical sensationalism is again spiking up the issue of whether to teach evolution in U.S. public schools, while in most other industrialized countries the dispute barely registers...Sutton's book deserves special praise for its socio-political analysis--for outlining Sister Aimee's pivotal role in giving birth to today's politicized evangelical Christianity.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Douglas Todd</b><b>, </b><b><i>Vancouver Sun</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Sutton helps readers see in McPherson more than one paradoxical woman: her Foursquare Gospel helped catalyze a fundamental cultural realignment that brought Pentecostals and Evangelicals into the American mainstream, transforming American politics in ways that continue to write today's headlines. A nuanced portrait of an entire movement.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Bryce Christensen</b><b>, </b><b><i>Booklist</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Sutton] reminds us that Aimee Semple McPherson 'exemplified evangelicalism's appeal to millions of Americans' and suggests that it is time to re-examine her life and legacy.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Bryan F. LeBeau</b><b>, </b><b><i>Kansas City Star</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In a clear and frightening way [<i>Aimee Semple McPherson and the Resurrection of Christian America</i>] both locates her origins in what could be called America's mainstream fringe and her influence on today's Christian right, with its political manipulating and media empires.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>George Fetherling</b><b>, </b><b><i>Seven Oaks</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Decades before televangelists like Billy Graham, Pat Robertson or Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker started mixing show business and conservative Christianity, there was Aimee Semple McPherson...An impressive new biography.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Don Lattin</b><b>, </b><b><i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Matthew Avery Sutton has done such a thorough and engaging job with <i>Aimee Semple McPherson and the Resurrection of Christian America</i>.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>John M. and Priscilla S.

Scher is now a partner at Pentagram, where she has worked since 1991."Make it bigger"-a familiar refrain to any graphic designer accustomed to presenting layouts to clients-is an apt title for a book that examines the graphic design profession primarily through the lens of the business community it serves. Veteran designer Scher draws from over three decades of design experience to provide readers with a firsthand account of the creative process, that is, advancing good ideas and personal vision within the corporate cultures and organizational dynamics that are predisposed to resist them. A focus on the collaboration necessary to bring design ideas to life sets this book apart from others in the genre. In addition to an interior packed with familiar work, the book's cover and jacket provide visual stopping power that supports the author's approach. Unfortunately, the book itself won't stand up well to heavy use. Though this work is mainly about the design profession, it will appeal to anyone working in a creative field, whether he or she is attempting to advance creative ideas or to chart a career trajectory concerned with personal growth and development. Best suited for larger public libraries or libraries with extensive liberal arts, fine arts, or business sections.<br><i>Phil Hamlett, Turner &amp; Assoc., San Francisco</i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Moral Combat: How Sex Divided American Christians and Fractured American Politics</h2><p><b>From an esteemed scholar of American religion and sexuality, a sweeping account of the century of religious conflict that produced our culture wars</b> <br>Gay marriage, transgender rights, birth control--sex is at the heart of many of the most divisive political issues of our age. The origins of these conflicts, historian R. Marie Griffith argues, lie in sharp disagreements that emerged among American Christians a century ago. From the 1920s onward, a once-solid Christian consensus regarding gender roles and sexual morality began to crumble, as liberal Protestants sparred with fundamentalists and Catholics over questions of obscenity, sex education, and abortion. Both those who advocated for greater openness in sexual matters and those who resisted new sexual norms turned to politics to pursue their moral visions for the nation. <i>Moral Combat</i> is a history of how the Christian consensus on sex unraveled, and how this unraveling has made our political battles over sex so ferocious and so intractable.</p><p><b>R. Marie Griffith </b>is the John C. Danforth Distinguished Professor at Washington University in St. Louis, where she directs the Danforth Center on Religion and Politics. She lives in St. Louis, Missouri."[Griffith] shows that at every turn in the culture wars of the last century or so, religious leaders have battled to obstruct gender, sexual, and racial equality.... The juxtaposition of deep dives and aerial views makes...a propulsive read. As do the wrinkles that complicate any easy political assumptions."&#x2015;<b>Laura Kipnis</b>, <b><i><b><i>New York Review of Books</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Magisterial...Griffith's observations are eerily prescient...<i>Moral Combat </i>is an impressive history of a massive fault line running through American history and politics: namely, sex."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Washington Post</i></b></i></b><br><br>"<i>Moral Combat</i> is a vivid illustration of a principle that liberals understand well and that religious conservatives usually do not: Culture precedes politics."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Marie Griffith...reviews a century's worth of American cultural conflict over sexuality, fueled by a growing divide between religious subcultures. Readers will benefit from her clear presentation of the longer history and larger significance of our sexual conflicts."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Christianity Today</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Griffith has undoubtedly performed a great service in documenting the influence of these largely forgotten reformers and ecumenical bodies. Her book is deeply researched, nuanced in its portrayals of activists on both sides, and thoroughly entertaining to boot."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i></b></i></b><br><br>"The story Griffith tells is crucial.... Her contribution is part of a much-needed sex education, and like all good teachers she presents it vividly."&#x2015;<b>Linda Gordon</b>, <b><i><b><i>New Republic</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Highly informative."&#x2015;<b><i><b>The Gospel Coalition</b></i></b><br><br>"[An] exceptional cultural history...Griffith's remarkably comprehensive book will be of interest to scholars and lay readers alike."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review)</b></i></b><br><br>"Griffith offers a carefully reasoned examination of the century-long political and religious controversies over sexuality that color our national character. Given the passions engendered by these controversies on both sides--conservative and liberal--she demonstrates that comity and compromise are perennially elusive, while consensus seems to be a word in an incomprehensible language. Happily Griffith brings welcome clarity and light to what otherwise might have been impenetrable murkiness."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Booklist</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Thoughtful study of the great schism between religious conservatives and progressives about women's control over their own bodies."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b></i></b></p><h2>Designing For Social Change: Strategies for Community-Based Graphic Design (Design Briefs)</h2><p>Some call it design for the greater good.

Following the format of his earlier Models of the Church, Dulles derives five models of character of this much-neglected theme of revelation. He considers revelation as doctrine, as history, as inner experience, as dialectical presence, and as new awareness.</p><p>Avery Cardinal Dulles, S.J. is a distinguished scholar in residence at Fordham University, former president of the Catholic Theological Society of America, and the author of many books. He was elevated to the College of Cardinals in 2001 by Pope John Paul II.</p><h2>The Watercolors of Chet Reneson</h2><p>For more than thirty years, collectors and sportsmen have been drawn to the spectacular watercolors of Chet Reneson. His paintings have graced the covers of such renowned sporting magazines as Sports Afield, Gray&#39;s Sporting Journal, and Sporting Classics. In 1982, he was rewarded with the distinction of being named Artist of the Year by three sporting and conservation organizations: Trout Unlimited, Ducks Unlimited, and the Atlantic Salmon Federation. He went on to be named again in subsequent years by Ducks Unlimited and the Atlantic Salmon Federation. One of America&#39;s finest sporting watercolorists and certainly one of its most prolific painters, gathered here for the first time are 110 of Chet&#39;s incredible paintings; the very best from three decades of work. Chet&#39;s longtime friend, artist Robert Abbett, presents a glimpse behind the art, of Reneson the man, through text that is equal parts interview, biography, and commentary. Both serious outdoorsmen and armchair sports will be moved by these evocative images. Whether readers are reminded of their own adventures or inspired to begin new ones, a journey through these pages is a trip not soon forgotten.</p><p></p><h2>Schlump</h2><p>An NYRB Classics Original<br><br>Seventeen-year-old Schlump marches off to war in 1915 because going to war is the best way to meet girls. And so he does, on his first posting, overseeing three villages in occupied France. But then Schlump is sent to the front, and the good times end.<br><br><i>Schlump</i>, written by Hans Herbert Grimm, was published anonymously in 1928 and was one of the first German novels to describe World War I in all its horror and absurdity, and it remains one of the best. What really sets it apart is its remarkable central character. Who is Schlump? A bit of a rascal and a bit of a sweetheart, a victim of his times, an inveterate survivor, maybe even a new type of man. At once comedy, documentary, hellhole, and fairy tale, <i>Schlump</i> is a gripping and disturbing book about the experience of trauma and what the great critic Walter Benjamin, writing at the same time as Hans Herbert Grimm, would call the death of experience, since perhaps if anything goes, nothing counts.</p><p><b>Hans Herbert Grimm</b> (1896&#x2013;1950) was born in the town of Markneukirchen and fought in World War I. After the war he taught Spanish, French, and English in Altenburg, and published <i>Schlump</i> anonymously in 1928 to avoid drawing his employer&#x2019;s attention to his pacificist beliefs. <i>Schlump </i>was not the commercial or popular success Grimm had hoped it would be, but his anonymity protected him when the book was burned by the Nazis in 1933. To avoid suspicion, Grimm joined the Nazi Party and worked as an interpreter in France during World War II. After the war, however, he was barred from teaching because of his party membership and began working in the theater and, later, in a sand mine. In 1950, two days after meeting with East German authorities, Grimm committed suicide; it is not known what was discussed at the meeting.<br><br><b>Jamie Bulloch</b> is a historian and translator of German literature.

But only a lie will save me! <p> GWENYTH PRAYED FOR DELIVERANCE, but God seemed very far away. She raised a trembling hand to her mouth and winced when her salty finger touched the split in her lip. Aye, God had finally deserted her for good. Last night, amid darkness and terror, someone had assaulted her. The windowless cell she&#x2019;d been dragged to was pitch dark, but the man hadn&#x2019;t needed any light to find and take what he came for. </p><p> False witness. </p><p> She lifted her gaze to the tall, clean-shaven man who stood on the other side of a table placed between them. Adam Mackintosh. How could it have been him? Even in her current state of confusion, she was certain her assailant wore a full beard, not the day-old stubble on Adam&#x2019;s face. See how the sun had kissed his cheeks and chin with color.

Plink, plink.<br><br>I squeezed my eyes shut, willing myself to go back to sleep, reminding myself that tomorrow (which was technically today, because before I could tell myself not to, I glanced at the clock and saw it was four in the morning) was the first day we'd feature Italian foods on the menu at Sophie's Terminal at the Tracks. Italian food is always popular. We'd be slammed, and I needed to be at the top of my restaurant manager/menu planner/staff cheerleader game.<br><br>I would be, too, I told myself.<br><br>If only I could get back to sleep.<br><br>Plink. Plink, plink.<br><br>I groaned, but not too loudly. At my side, Declan Fury, he of the overwhelming Irish family, with the sometimes annoying tendency to try and do my thinking for me and-not coincidentally-the sexiest guy I'd met in as long as I could remember, slept quietly, his breaths even, that chipped-from-granite chest of his rising and falling to a rhythm so relaxing, it was hard to imagine that just a few hours ago, he'd made my blood sing, my temperature soar, and every inch of me glad that I'd gone out on the proverbial limb (not an easy thing for a woman who'd grown up in the foster system) and let him know that I was as crazy about him as he was about me. I can't say if it's true that Declan's family was involved in the local Irish mob, but I do know one thing-he's something of a thief himself. In the year since I'd arrived in Hubbard, Ohio, he'd stolen a heart I wasn't sure I had before I arrived.<br><br>Plink. Plink, plink.<br><br>I propped myself up on my elbows and cocked my head, listening at the same time I tried to make sense of the noise.<br><br>The tapping sound wasn't inside Pacifique, the house I'd recently inherited from a dear friend. It was outside, rapping on the windows, each little knock sounding like something quick and hard against the glass.<br><br>Plink. Plink, plink.<br><br>Reality hit and just like that, I sat up like a shot and I was already out of bed and reaching for my clothes when Declan rolled to his side.<br><br>"What's going on?" He didn't look like an attorney, or like the manager of his family's Irish gift shop, for that matter. His hair was always a little too shaggy, and now it drooped over his forehead. He pushed it back with the same hand he used to rub the sleep out of his eyes. "Laurel, what are you doing?"<br><br>"I have to get outside!" Well, at least that's what I meant to say. The fact that I was jumping up and down on one foot then the other, tugging on my jeans, made it come out sounding more like, "Ihatogetside!"<br><br>To Declan's eternal credit, this did not stop him from sitting up and swinging his long legs over the side of the bed. "What wrong?"<br><br>I had already tugged a sweatshirt over my head and poked my feet into my slippers and I darted out into the hallway. "Ice! There's an ice storm!"<br><br>I wasn't surprised that by the time I got down to the kitchen, he was right beside me. When it came to loyalty, love, and offering a helping hand, Declan could move pretty fast.<br><br>He finished tugging his sweater over his head, peered over my shoulder, and saw the same thing I'd seen when I looked out the window of the back door: there was already a thin sheen of ice covering the glass, and more pellets plinked down by the second. Plink. Plink, plink. Like rifle shot.<br><br>It had been a warm spring, and hey, I was a California girl. Though I'd been warned by Sophie, Declan, and everyone else who'd seen me in my aqua Windbreaker the past week that spring in Ohio could be fickle, I'd already sent my heavy winter coat to the cleaners. With no choice, I shrugged into the Windbreaker and frantically searched the floor, my voice bumping to the same staccato tempo as my heart.<br><br>"My boots! What did I do with my boots?"<br><br>I didn't wait for my brain to kick in and provide the answer. I grabbed a pile of newspapers that I'd set on the kitchen table, ready to put in the recycling bin, and raced out the back door in my slippers.<br><br>A wicked wind slapped my face. Insult to injury, because cold seeped through my jacket, mud spurted around my slippers with every step I took, and the relentless, icy pellets tapped against my cheeks and hair. I squinted against the onslaught and raced toward the barn.<br><br>A little background and geography might be in order.<br><br>Pacifique was an idyllic farm and once the home of Raquel Arnaud-Rocky, as her friends called her-a woman who had built a reputation as the area's purveyor of the finest produce. Rocky grew vegetables and herbs and provided them to restaurants and discerning chefs all over northern and eastern Ohio, and when she was murdered the fall before, I had inherited the house and the farm. My background? I was once the personal chef of Meghan Cohan, Hollywood superstar. I knew plenty about cooking food, and nothing about growing it, but in Rocky's name and in honor of her memory, I was sure going to try.<br><br>Which explains the order of tomato plants that had arrived just the day before.<br><br>Which explains why, in my gardening na�vet and my belief that mild temperatures meant that winter was over for good, I'd never thought to haul them under cover, but left them out in the pool of sunshine against the side of the barn.<br><br>Yeah, that golden pool of sunshine.<br><br>The one that was now a quagmire of mud and icy slush.<br><br>I slogged through it, cold mud seeping through my slippers and squishing between my toes, and I closed in on the three dozen heirloom tomato plants that I'd been so proud of such a short while before.<br><br>Then, they'd been tall and leafy.<br><br>Then, they were the perfect fresh green that held the promise of spring and a summer to follow.<br><br>Then, each and every plant was a sign, at least to me. They reminded me of my commitment to Pacifique. They were living proof of the dream I had to provide fresh vegetables for the restaurant, just as Rocky had, food I'd worked to bring alive with my own two hands.<br><br>I took one look at those tomatoes now getting flogged by the ice and I swear, I heard each and every one of them scream in pain.<br><br>"I've got to save them!" I wailed, and I would not be deterred, even when behind me, Declan said something that sounded way too much like too late. Like the deranged, determined farming maniac I'd suddenly become, I grabbed the sheets of newspaper, one after the other, and laid them over the plants.<br><br>"It's not going to help." Declan took my arm, but I was not about to be put off. I pulled away from him and peeled off sheet after sheet of newspaper, each page quickly turning the consistency of oatmeal as the sleet rained down, and laid them over the tops of the plants.<br><br>"That's what they say to do," I said, and I'm not sure if I was trying to convince Declan or myself that it might actually help. "In all the gardening articles online. That's what they say to do if there's going to be frost. You have to cover the plants with newspaper."<br><br>"You had to cover the plants with newspaper." I did not fail to miss his use of the past tense. "And that only applies to frost, anyway. Even if you had the plants covered, that wouldn't have protected them from this. Now that they're already covered with ice-"<br><br>"They'll be fine, as soon as the sun comes up, they'll warm right up and perk right up, and-"<br><br>Who was I kidding?<br><br>I blinked away the icy drops that clouded my vision and stared down at the blanket of newspapers quickly turning to mush.<br><br>As fate would have it, Meghan Cohan's face stared back at me.<br><br>For a moment, I forgot the cold and the ice and even the tomato plants. Here I was in the middle of the night, muddy and defeated. And there was Meghan's picture on the front page of the Entertainment section. She looked like a million bucks (make that two, because Meghan never did anything small) in a gown cut up to here and down to there, on the red carpet at the Tribeca Film Festival.<br><br>"Laurel?" When Declan put an arm around my shoulders, I jumped.<br><br>"Sorry." I tried not to, but I couldn't help myself. In spite of the heat of Declan's body against mine, I shivered. With one trembling finger, I pointed toward Meghan's picture. "The face that launched a thousand career disappointments."<br><br>"You're going to launch a thousand cold germs if we don't get out of the cold and inside quick."<br><br>I wasn't about to argue with him.<br><br>I'd like to say we raced back to the house, but by this time, racing was out of the question. Wet through to the skin, mud up to our ankles, frozen to the bone, we plodded back to the house through a curtain of ice. I kicked off my slippers at the door and dropped them right in the trash and it wasn't until I dragged into the kitchen that I realized the wetness on my cheeks wasn't ice, it was tears.<br><br>I sobbed. "I took all the time to do my research. I ordered the tomatoes I thought would do best in our climate and our soil. I found recipes that I can use them in. I was so proud of them when they arrived. They were perfect. And now . . ." I burst into tears. "I killed them!"<br><br>Declan pulled me into a quick hug. Since he was as soaked as I was, I didn't even flinch when his wet jacket pressed against mine. "Hey, you've never been a farmer before. You didn't know."<br><br>I sniffled. "I should have. I did my homework. I read that the last frost date around here is in the middle of May. But it's been so beautiful, I just figured winter was over. And no one warned me about ice storms."<br><br>"See? That proves it."<br><br>I wasn't sure what it proved, but that would have to wait since Declan slipped off my jacket, took off his own, and disappeared upstairs. He came back to the kitchen carrying my terry cloth robe and a change of clothes for himself.<br><br>"Come on." He urged me with a wave of one finger. "Get out of those wet clothes before you catch your death."<br><br>Sure, I was feeling like a drowned rat, but that didn't erase the memory of everything we'd done since Declan arrived at Pacifique: I made dinner, we shared a bottle of wine and more than a few laughs, and-<br><br>Tomato killer that I was, I still somehow managed a smile. "If I get out of my wet clothes, will you keep me warm?"<br><br>He'd already peeled out of his sweater and jeans and tossed them into the kitchen sink and he poked his feet into the legs of flannel lounge pants and pulled a sweatshirt over his head. Declan didn't live at Pacifique with me; he had a house in Hubbard near the gift shop he managed and the Terminal at the Tracks, where I worked. But he kept some things at the farm, things like a shaving kit and clothes, for just-in-case times like this.<br><br>He gave me a lopsided smile. "I will not keep you warm. Not like I did last night, anyway. Because it's nearly five and if we start what you want to start-what I want to start-you're going to be late getting to the restaurant." He motioned again for me to disrobe. "But I will make coffee. How does that sound?"<br><br>Not nearly as good as what I had in mind, but I knew he was right. I was too wet and too cold and feeling too guilty to do anything but give up without a fight.<br><br>While Declan made coffee and popped English muffins into the toaster, I got out of my clothes and into my robe.<br><br>The warmth was heavenly, not to mention therapeutic. By the time I sank down into a kitchen chair, I felt better. Not a lot better, but better.<br><br>At least until Declan sat down in the chair across from mine.<br><br>"So did you mean that?" he asked. "Are you really disappointed Meghan Cohan ruined your brilliant Hollywood cooking career and you ended up here?"<br><br>I was just taking a swallow of coffee and it stuck behind the lump in my throat. "That's not what I said."<br><br>"It's what you implied."<br><br>"Stop acting like a lawyer." Across the table I made a face at him, hoping it would lighten the mood. Since he jumped up to fetch the English muffins along with the butter and raspberry jam that were in the fridge, I wasn't sure it worked.<br><br>"You know what I meant," I told him after he sat down, but not until I'd taken a bite of my muffin. "When I first got here, yeah, I was plenty disappointed that Meghan accused me of leaking gossip to the paparazzi when it wasn't true. I was devastated when she fired me and used her chops to make sure no other celebrity would hire me."<br><br>"And now?"<br><br>I reached across the table and folded a hand over his. "You know how I feel now. Pacifique . . ." I glanced around the kitchen. When Rocky lived there, the house was a combination of museum, showroom, and carnival. Rocky was a firm believer that if she saw something she liked, she had to own it. And if she liked it and owned it, she needed to enjoy it. And if she was going to enjoy it, she had to have it out on display. All the time.<br><br>Rocky had eclectic tastes, and many beautiful and interesting things, but back when she was in residence at Pacifique, I sometimes found it hard to breathe in a house chockablock with porcelain figurines, paintings, fabric draped over furniture, silk flowers, and peacock feathers.<br><br>Over the last months, I'd pared down most of the clutter. I'd given some of Rocky's mementos to Sophie, the sister of my foster mother and the owner of the Terminal at the Tracks, because Rocky and Sophie had been friends since college and I knew no one treasured Rocky's memory like Sophie did. Other things-mountains of lace tablecloths, piles of linen napkins, stacks of floral handkerchiefs-I'd offered to Inez and Dolly, the waitresses over at the Terminal, and to Declan's various sisters, sisters-in-law, and cousins because really, there was only so much I needed and I figured I might as well spread the beauty. The parlor where Rocky had died I'd completely redone; I'd bought new furniture, painted the walls, switched out the area rug Rocky loved so much-one with a white background decorated with huge pink and blue roses-for a tasteful Oriental in shades of maroon, tobacco, and sage. The bedrooms that had been packed with gorgeous things, artsy things, whimsical things, were pared down to the essentials. The kitchen . . .</p><h2>Blood Rain: An Aurelio Zen Mystery</h2><p>Aurelio Zen&#x2014;cynical and tough, yet worn down from years of law enforcement&#x2014;has just been given the worst assignment he could imagine. He has been sent to the heart of hostile territory: Sicily, the ancient, beautiful island where blood has been known to flow like wine, and the distinction between the police and the criminals is a fine one. Even worse, he has been sent to spy on the elite anti-Mafia squad.The only thing that makes the job palatable&#x2014;and takes his mind off routine details like the rotting body found in a remote train car&#x2014;is that Zen's adopted daughter, Carla, is also in town. But life becomes precarious for Carla when she stumbles upon some information she'd be better off not knowing and befriends a local magistrate on the Mafia's most wanted list. What ensues is a breakneck plot of amazing complexity that culminates in a stunning finale. <i>Blood Rain</i>, emotionally gripping and defiantly original, is surely one of Dibdin's finest works.</p><p><b>Penzler Pick, May 2000:</b> Dibdin's six Aurelio Zen novels (beginning with <i>Ratking</i>, which won the 1988 Golden Dagger Award) are as vividly Italian as if this English writer had never strayed far from the Via Veneto, despite the fact that he has, in fact, been expatriated for several years now to the Pacific Northwest. His hero, a battle-weary but still morally engaged Roman police investigator, is one of the more elegantly vulnerable characters in the genre, a figure who resembles Nicolas Freeling's Inspector Van der Valk in his ability to bring triumph to situations and yet never have them seem like victories. Moreover, like Van der Valk, Zen's greatest talent seems to be for making new enemies among his colleagues. <p> In <i>Blood Rain</i>, Zen has been exiled to Sicily under the guise of acting as a sort of watchdog, observing a recently reestablished anti-Mafia taskforce. By the nature of the locale--Sicily makes its own rules--the fact that the work of this commission will inevitably be compromised seems clear. But where the cracks in the system will reveal themselves is harder to figure out until, of course, it's too late. Distracted by his dying mother back in Rome and by the island's perverse feuds and even stranger loyalties, and paying not quite enough attention to the professional travails of his beautiful adopted daughter, Carla, a computer specialist, Zen travels his usual idiosyncratic route to a crime's resolution. As always, he is most intrigued by the ambiguities of the situation--and is doomed to be the sacrificial scapegoat.</p><p> Dibdin seems to be incapable of writing a bad book, and the Zen novels are his best work. <i>Blood Rain</i> causes the reader to gasp frequently in genuine surprise, as well as in admiration for the way Dibdin accomplishes his effects. The intensity of these sensations is something to be grateful for, since most books these days, even with their ability to shock, make us <i>feel</i> so little. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p>"[Dibdin's] manifold gifts as a storyteller are in evidence here, affirming his expertise in the genre."<br>-- <i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><h2>Savage Thunder (Wyoming-Western Series, 2)</h2><p>Newly widowed after a shockingly brief marriage to an elderly British lord, Jocelyn Fleming still aches with the pain of unexplored desire.

Ms. Lindsey lives in New England with her family.</p>Lindsey's ( Defy Not the Heart ) latest is an exercise in formula writing, with no more passion than a stack of index cards. The story pairs a quintessential Lindsey heroine and hero, but the sparks don't fly. Jocelyn Fleming, a young English widow traveling across the U.S. to escape a murderous detective, and Colt Thunder, a half-Cheyenne drifter with an implacable hatred of white women, never quite become convincing characters. The plot, obstacle-heavy and motivation-thin, fails the duo and never tests the mettle Lindsey clearly intends each principal to have. Neither narrative nor romance is sufficiently robust to sustain the long, long trek through the still-wild West. Diehard Lindsey fans will probably enjoy going through the motions with Jocelyn and Colt, as even this weak showing is characteristically stylish, but the bestselling romancer won't win new admirers. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Wordworks : A Grammar Handbook for the Truly Desperate</h2><p>A significantly different grammar handbook for grades 7-9 that presents parts of speech, parts of sentence, phrases, clauses, run-ons and fragments, and most frequent errors in a simple, clear, interesting, and, even fun way.

His refutation of the possibility that the Shroud was painted in the Middle Ages is engagingly presented and argued: the STURP scientists' examination of the Shroud's fibers found no trace of medieval paint pigments, and no attempts to replicate the Shroud using techniques available to medieval artists have succeeded so far. Antonacci also makes a strong case against the results of the 1988 carbon-dating, which assigned the Shroud's origin to the 14th century. Although the section is confusingly organized, he convincingly argues that the procedure violated existing protocols for carbon-dating, using a poorly chosen sample that compromised the results because it had sustained fire and water damage in 1532. He also provides some evidence that the carbon-dating methods available in the 1980s offered limited accuracy at best, especially when applied to textiles. There is a big difference, however, between calling for more research to explain the Shroud's anomalous features, and proving that those features resulted from miraculous forces. Antonacci attempts to fill this gap with hypotheses that he treats as facts, and with violent leaps of logic. The discussion of archaeological and historical evidence intended to establish the Shroud's compatibility with first-century practices and biblical accounts is riddled with inaccuracies, decontextualized information, circular reasoning, and unfounded assumptions.Antonacci's research will reinforce the faith of those who already believe in the Shroud, but is unlikely to win any converts among empirical-minded skeptics. -- <i>Copyright � 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP.

At first they&#x2019;re a little cold&#x2014;that&#x2019;s the nature of a defense contractor&#x2014;but then one of the DCs says, &#x2018;Come on, now. We need someone to host the next war. Any volunteers?&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; Specialist Matthew Ransom says with a grin as he presents himself to me for a mandatory equipment check.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is serious, Ransom.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry, LT.&#x201d;<br> <br>I initiate the check anyway, making an inventory of his gear and confirming that every cinch on his exoskeleton is secure while I pick up the thread of my story.<br> <br>&#x201c;&#x2018;Any volunteers.&#x2019; That&#x2019;s a joke, see? Because a DC will never allow a war in their own country. Rule one: Don&#x2019;t kill off your taxpayers. War is what you inflict on other people.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the truth, sir,&#x201d; Jaynie says in a bitter undertone as she initiates an equipment check for Private First Class Yafiah Yeboah.<br> <br>Maybe I&#x2019;m getting through to her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Anyway, the joke works, the ice is broken, and ideas start getting tossed around until one of the DCs says, &#x2018;Hey, I&#x2019;ve got it. Let&#x2019;s do a war in the Sahel. It&#x2019;s good, open terrain. No nasty jungles. It&#x2019;s not quite desert, and we&#x2019;ve already got a figurehead in Ahab Matugo.&#x2019; This sounds pretty good to everybody, so they agree: The next regional war, the one that will keep them in business for another three or four years, or even a decade if things go well, is right here in Africa&#x2019;s Sahel, between the equatorial rain forest and the Sahara.&#x201d;<br> <br>I reach the last point of inspection, crouched in the mud beside Matt Ransom&#x2019;s left boot where it&#x2019;s strapped into the exoskeleton&#x2019;s floating footplate. Everything looks good, so I slap his thigh strut and tell him, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re clear.&#x201d;<br> <br>The frame of my own exoskeleton flexes as I stand. There&#x2019;s a faint sigh from the joints as the struts alongside my legs boost me up with no effort on my part, despite the weight of my eighty-pound backpack. The mechanical joints release a faint, sterile scent of mineral lubricant, barely detectable against the organic reek of mud and dogs.<br> <br>I turn back to Jaynie. She pauses in her equipment check and asks, &#x201c;So now the defense contractors have to get the war started, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;First they have to choose sides, but a coin toss will do it. China winds up as primary backer of Ahab Matugo, and an Arab alliance takes the status quo&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;LT,&#x201d; Ransom interrupts, &#x201c;you want me to clear you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah. Go ahead.&#x201d; I run my gloved hand over my skullcap as he begins tugging on cinches and checking power levels. I&#x2019;m remembering the buildup to this war, watching it happen while I served my first combat tour at the tail end of Bolivia. I try hard to keep my voice calm. &#x201c;So we Americans . . . we don&#x2019;t jump in right away. We have another war to wind up first, so we promise to intervene when humanitarian issues demand it&#x2014;but we don&#x2019;t discuss what side to come in on because it doesn&#x2019;t fucking matter. Everyone knows we don&#x2019;t understand the local politics and we don&#x2019;t give a shit anyway. There&#x2019;s nothing in this region we want. The only reason we&#x2019;re jumping in is so that our defense contractors can keep their shareholders happy. The American taxpayers will listen to their hoo-rah propaganda media outlets and pony up the money, blaming the liberals for the bad economy while brain-draining the underclass into the army because hey, it&#x2019;s a job, and even the DCs can&#x2019;t convince Congress to spend ten million dollars each on a combat robot when you can get a fully qualified flesh-and-blood high-IQ soldier for two hundred and fifty thousand.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ransom steps back. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re clear, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>I ignore him. &#x201c;And that, Sergeant, is the reason we are here at Fort Dassari, squatting in a country where we&#x2019;re not wanted and we don&#x2019;t belong, and it&#x2019;s why we get to go on a hike tonight and every night through hostile terrain, giving other people who also don&#x2019;t belong here a chance to kill us. We are not here for glory&#x2014;there isn&#x2019;t any&#x2014;and there&#x2019;s nothing at stake. Our goals are to stay alive, to avoid civilian casualties, and to kill anyone with an interest in killing us. In nine months, no soldier has died under my command and I&#x2019;d like to keep it that way. Is that understood?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jaynie keeps her face carefully neutral. &#x201c;Yes, sir, that is understood.&#x201d; And then, because she&#x2019;s not about to be intimi�dated by a male lieutenant five years her junior and with a quarter of her combat experience, she adds, &#x201c;Guidance described you as a crazy motherfucker, sir&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Behind Jaynie, Yafiah claps a hand to her mouth, stifling a snort of laughter.<br> <br>&#x201c;&#x2014;but they promised me, no matter how much of an asshole you are, they won&#x2019;t walk us into an ambush.&#x201d;<br> <br>I smile pleasantly. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve come close a few times.&#x201d;<br> <br>As the most northeastern in a line of remote border forts, we are more exposed than most. The fort itself is our shelter, our base of operations. Its fifteen-foot-high walls enclose the housing unit and a yard just big enough to park two tanks&#x2014;not that we have tanks, but we do have three ATVs stored under an accordion canopy.<br> <br>Our mission lies outside the walls. We do interdiction&#x2014;hunting for insurgents filtering down from the north, while the insurgents go hunting for us. Guidance doesn&#x2019;t always spot them in time, which is one reason we keep a pack of five dogs. They&#x2019;re not official army issue, but the motto of the linked combat squads is Innovation, Coordination, Inspiration . . . meaning as an LCS we get leeway to come up with our own strategies.<br> <br>&#x201c;One more thing, sir,&#x201d; Jaynie says as I turn away. &#x201c;Is it true you&#x2019;re cyborged?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just an ocular overlay.&#x201d; I touch my gloved finger to the corner of my eye. &#x201c;Like built-in contact lenses, but they receive and display data.&#x201d;<br> <br>The gold line tattooed along the curve of my jaw is an antenna, and tiny audio buds are embedded in my ears, but I don&#x2019;t mention those.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not linked to the outside world, are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;From a war zone? Not a chance. The only link I&#x2019;m allowed is to Guidance.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;re hooked into Guidance even when you&#x2019;re not wearing the helmet?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You got it. Everything I see, everything I hear, gets piped straight upstairs.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why is that, sir?&#x201d;<br> <br>Not a discussion I want to get into right now, so I turn my attention to the last of our little crew. Private First Class Dubey Lin is standing on the catwalk, nine feet above the ground, peering through a machine-gun port at the surrounding trees. Dubey over-relies on organic sight, but he&#x2019;s always ready to go on time and he never argues. Actually, he never says much of anything at all. &#x201c;Dubey!&#x201d; I shout. &#x201c;Get down here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir!&#x201d;<br> <br>He jumps to the ground, letting the shocks of his exoskeleton take the impact and startling the dogs, who are so wound up in anticipation of the night&#x2019;s patrol that they lunge at one another. Vicious growls erupt as they spin around in play fights. Ransom gets in on it, launching a few kung fu kicks and chops in Dubey&#x2019;s direction, flexing his exoskeleton&#x2019;s leg and arm struts, but Dubey ignores him, as always.<br> <br>In the LCS ranks, we&#x2019;ve nicknamed the exoskeletons our &#x201c;dead sisters&#x201d; because all the parts except the floating footplates look a lot like human bones. Shocked struts with knee articulation run up the outside of the legs to the hips. Across the back, the rig takes an hourglass shape to minimize profile, ending in a shoulder-spanning arch that easily supports both the weight of a field pack and the leverage that can be generated by the slender arm struts.<br> <br>Packets of microprocessors detect a soldier&#x2019;s movements, translating them to the rig in customized motion algorithms. A soldier in an exoskeleton can get shot dead and never fall down. I saw that in Bolivia. And if there&#x2019;s enough power left in the dead sister, it can walk the body back to a safe zone for recovery. I&#x2019;ve seen that too. Sometimes the dead just keep walking, right through my dreams. Not that I&#x2019;d ever admit that to Guidance.<br> <br>Jaynie pushes me a little harder. &#x201c;So if Guidance is listening in on everything you say, sir, why do you keep talking shit?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We have to play the game, Sergeant. We don&#x2019;t have to like it. Now, helmets on!&#x201d;<br> <br>We all disappear behind full-face visors tuned to an opaque black.<br> <br>Tiny fans vent cool air across my face as I watch an array of icons come up on my visor&#x2019;s display. They assure me I&#x2019;m fully linked: to my skullcap; to my M-CL1a assault rifle; to each one of my soldiers; to my angel, soaring invisibly high in the night sky; and to my handler at Guidance. &#x201c;Delphi, you there?&#x201d;<br> <br>Her familiar voice answers, &#x201c;Gotcha, Shelley.&#x201d;<br> <br>They don&#x2019;t call us a linked combat squad for nothing.<br> <br>I use my gaze to shuffle through the displays of each soldier in my LCS, confirming that they&#x2019;re linked too.<br> <br>Technically, every linked combat squad should have nine pairs of boots on the ground, but at Dassari we&#x2019;ve never had more than six, and due to personnel transfers, we were down to four before Jaynie got here. The army likes to brag that every LCS soldier is an elite soldier, meeting strict physical and intellectual requirements, with a demonstrated ability to adapt to new systems and circumstances. Translated, this means we&#x2019;re chronically shorthanded, and no one gets a night off.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s all stay awake,&#x201d; I say over gen-com. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been too quiet these past few nights. We&#x2019;re due.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir!&#x201d; Ransom answers like this is good news. Yafiah swears softly. Dubey kicks at the ground in frustration. Only Jaynie doesn&#x2019;t get it.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know something we don&#x2019;t?&#x201d; she asks over gen-com.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just a feeling.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ransom says, &#x201c;Sometimes God whispers in his ear.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;LT,&#x201d; Yafiah pleads. She knows what&#x2019;s coming, and so do I, but I don&#x2019;t try to rein him in. Ransom is my favorite redneck of all time. He loves everyone, but he&#x2019;ll still kill anybody I tell him to without hesitation. His way of explaining the world may be nonstandard, but his enthusiasms have kept us both alive.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am, this here is King David,&#x201d; he informs the sergeant. &#x201c;Saul don&#x2019;t dare touch a hair of the man&#x2019;s head and Goliath can&#x2019;t get his bullets to fly straight when the lieutenant&#x2019;s around, because James Shelley is beloved of God. Do what LT tells you and you might live long enough to see Frankfurt one more time.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ransom is six three. He has a hundred pounds of muscle over Yafiah and a year more experience, but as far as she&#x2019;s concerned, he&#x2019;s the dumb little brother. She turns the blank black face of her visor toward Jaynie and says, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry none about Ransom, ma&#x2019;am. He&#x2019;s kind of crazy, but he&#x2019;s good in the field.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jaynie sounds honestly puzzled when she asks me, &#x201c;How can you be King David, LT? Because I would have sworn that we were Goliath.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Goliath,&#x201d; I murmur, using my gaze to select the encyclo�pedia icon from my overlay, because the truth is, I don&#x2019;t really know the Bible story.<br> <br>But before I can listen to the abstract of the Goliath entry, Dubey surprises us all by actually speaking. &#x201c;King David played his own game,&#x201d; he says, his shy voice amplified over gen-com. &#x201c;And he didn&#x2019;t lose.&#x201d;<br> <br>Good enough for me.<br> <br>I whistle at the dogs. The fort&#x2019;s gate swings open. We head out into moonlight, the five of us, Dassari LCS. The fort will defend itself while we&#x2019;re away.<br> <br>� � � �<br> <br>We spread out so we can cover more territory, and so one bomb blast, one rocket, won&#x2019;t take out all of us. The primary weapon we carry is the M-CL1a, also known as the Harkin Integrated Tactical Rifle, yielding an acronym only a gamer could love. The HITR uses AI sights to fire both a 7.62-millimeter round, accurate to five hundred meters, and programmable grenades from the underslung launcher. We&#x2019;re also armed with a handy assortment of hand grenades&#x2014;frag, flash-bang, smoke. Subtlety is not our talent. We&#x2019;re rigged to hit fast and hard. Powered by the dead sisters, with photomultiplier-based night vision to see where we&#x2019;re going, we&#x2019;re able to make a sweep through the entire district on most nights.<br> <br>Near the fort the land is flat, and much of it is cultivated, marked off by tall fences that protect sorghum fields and tree farms from roving goats and wandering cattle. But after a couple of kilometers, the farms end. Then it&#x2019;s mostly scattered trees that look a lot like the mesquite I saw in Texas. We&#x2019;re well into the rainy season, so all the trees are leafed out and where there used to be bare red ground between them, wild grass is growing almost head-high. The dogs run through it, hunting for rogue soldiers.<br> <br>A light wind sighs past, setting the grass swaying around me. I know it&#x2019;s rustling, but my helmet&#x2019;s audio pickups are set to filter out white noise, so I can barely hear it, while more distinct sounds reach me clearly: the panting of the dogs, the lowing of cattle, a bird&#x2019;s piping call.<br> <br>With the grass so tall I can&#x2019;t see very far, but I keep a map overlaid on my visor with the position of each one of my soldiers marked. The map is constantly updated with data gathered by my angel&#x2014;a toy drone with a three-foot wingspan, piloted by a semiautonomous AI. The angel watches over us. Everything within range of its camera eyes is recorded, and the raw video is boosted to Guidance. In offices in Frankfurt, Charleston, and Sacramento, our handlers scan the raw feed, while Intelligence teams run analytical programs to pick up any bogeys human eyes might miss.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s always something to see. This is the Old World. People have made their homes here since the beginning of time and they&#x2019;ll probably still be here come the last day&#x2014;which might not be as far off as we&#x2019;d like to think.<br> <br>Yeah, apocalyptic thoughts come a little too easily these days.<br> <br>Anyway, it doesn&#x2019;t matter how empty this land looks; it is inhabited. People live here, raising their children and their livestock, most of them preten...</p><h2>A Once-and-Coming Spirit at Pentecost: Essays on the Liturgical Readings Between Easter and Pentecost</h2><p><p>Father Brown completes his look at the great seasons of the liturgical year, making the rich insights of modern biblical exegesis conveniently available to all, with this volume for the season from Easter to Pentecost.</p> <p>During this season the Church reads consecutively from the Acts of the Apostles, recounting the external life of the Church after Pentecost. The accompanying readings from the Gospel according to John portray the internal life of Christian disciples and promise a coming Paraclete to be sent by the Father. Father Brown's title <i>A Once-and-Coming Spirit</i> signifies these two great biblical sources that he reflects on. He shows how these readings speak to our time as we live out the external history of a visible Church while internally drawing life from Jesus as branches on the vine. His comments offer an opportunity to appreciate the intent of the season after Easter and to prepare ourselves for the intensified gift of the spirit at Pentecost.</p></p><p>Raymond E. Brown, S.S., (1928-1998) was the Auburn Distinguished Professor of Biblical Studies at Union Theological Seminary in New York City. He was author of some forty books on the Bible and past president of three of the most important biblical societies in the world. By appointment of two popes (Paul VI in 1972, John Paul II in 1996) Brown was a member of the Roman Pontifical Biblical Commission. <i>Time</i> magazine called him "probably the premier Catholic Scripture scholar of the U.S."Homilists, liturgists, and those who draw inspiration for their prayer from the lectionary texts will appreciate this concise set of reflections on the liturgical readings from Easter to Pentecost.The Bible Today<br><br>Studded with insights that are spring-boards to reflection or discussion.The Pecos Benedictine<br><br> . . . an excellent book for spiritual reading during this season and, given the thrust of the book, it could also prove useful for a college level course or a serious adult education group focusing on the church.Emmanuel</p><h2>Postmodern Geographies: The Reassertion of Space in Critical Social Theory (Second Edition) (Radical Thinkers)</h2><p><i>Postmodern Geographies</i> stands as the cardinal broadcast and defence of theory&#x2019;s &#x201c;spatial turn.&#x201d; From the suppression of space in modern social science and the disciplinary aloofness of geography to the spatial returns of Foucault and Lefebvre and the construction of Marxist geographies alert to urbanization and global development, renowned geographer Edward W. Soja details the trajectory of this turn and lays out its key debates. An expanded critique of historicism and a refined grasp of materialist dialectics bolster Soja&#x2019;s attempt to introduce geography to postmodernity, animating a series of engagements with Heidegger, Giddens, Castells, and others.

Included are chapters on the Pueblos, the Hopi, and the Zuni; the Pimans, the Yaqui, and the River Yumans; the Upland Yumans, the Apache, the Navajo, and the Southern Paiute. It explores each group's environmental adaptation, linguistic affiliation, social organization, history, world view, material culture, and ceremonial institutions. Native Americans speak about contemporary issues such as the repatriation of sacred objects, reservation gambling, preservation of native plants, and the philosophy behind tribal colleges. </p><br><p>"The combination of a scholarly and lyrical style makes <i>Native Peoples of the Southwest</i> highly informative and a pleasure to read. Reminiscent in its historical truthfulness of Dee Brown's <i>Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee</i>, this is a scholarly text that American Indians would want for their own children's higher education. And a must read for non-Indians who want to understand the true history of Southwestern American Indians. Native Peoples of the Southwest authoritatively answers why Indian people persistently and proudly are committed to preserving and maintaining their language, culture, and traditions within a society that nearly annihilated them, and provides hope that those who read it will join American Indians in cherishing and supporting the preservation of these living cultural treasures that bless this great land known for a short historical time as America."--Glenn Johnson, M.

Yet despite all the attention and even obsession devoted to sex, human sexuality remains confusing and even foreboding. What, after all, is authentic human sexuality? That is the question Judith and Jack Balswick set out to answer in this wide-ranging and probing book. Informed by sociology, psychology and theology, the Balswicks investigate how human sexuality originates both biologically and socially, lay groundwork for a normative Christian interpretation of sexuality, show how authentic sexuality is necessarily grounded in relationships, and explore such forms of "inauthentic sexuality" as sexual harassment, pornography and rape. Since its first publication in 1999, <em>Authentic Human Sexuality</em> has established itself as a standard text at numerous colleges and seminaries. While maintaining the book's overall structure, this new paper edition offers updated discussions and bibliographies throughout, including a completely new chapter on sexual development throughout the human lifespan and a substantially revised chapter on sexual beings in relationship that incorporates a trinitarian theological perspective. A new generation of students, pastors, psychologists and sociologists engaged in counseling will be indebted to the Balswicks for this updated study of this endlessly fascinating and perplexing facet of human identity.</p><p><strong>Jack O.

It had been six months since I'd left California and arrived in Hubbard, Ohio, to run what I thought was Sophie's white-linen-and-candlelight restaurant while she had knee-replacement surgery. Six months since I found out that the elegant restaurant she'd lied about for years was really a greasy spoon in an old train station that anchored a battered-but-trying-to-gentrify part of town.<br><br> Six months since I'd been embroiled as much in murder as I was in cooking.<br><br> The thought hit, and a touch like icy fingers squirmed its way up my back. I twitched it aside and called over my shoulder. "<i>Bonsoir</i>, Sophie. Any sign of Rocky yet?"<br><br> "No! She is nowhere to be seen, yes?" Sophie tried for a French lilt that pinged around the tile and stainless steel kitchen and fell flat. With her usual good humor, she laughed it away and came up behind me so she could stand on tiptoe and peek over my shoulder at the six quiches on the counter.<br><br> "Oh, Laurel, they look fabulous!" Sophie breathed in deep. "Think six will be enough?"<br><br> I wiped my hands on the white apron looped around my neck. "We've got three more in the fridge and George will pop them in the oven if we need them," I told Sophie at the same time I glanced across the kitchen. George Porter was leaning back against the industrial fridge, his beefy arms crossed over his massive chest, and a scowl on his face that pretty much said all there was to say about what he thought of quiche.<br><br> In spite of the scowl&#x2014;or maybe because of it&#x2014;I gave him the kind of smile that said I was sure he was on board with my plan.<br><br> George didn't smile back.<br><br> But then, what did I expect?<br><br> The Terminal's longtime cook was a mountain of a man with more tats on his arms than I had fingers and toes, a meat-and-potatoes kind of guy who was as happy as a cholesterol-challenged clam cooking up the fried eggs, fried baloney, fried steak, and fried chicken that for years had been the staples of the Terminal menu. That is, before I arrived and started introducing healthier dishes and, in a flash of inspiration, featuring ethnic specials.<br><br> We'd started with Irish, and that summer had tried Japanese (sushi did not exactly go over big with the Hubbard crowd) and Chinese (popular, but there were plenty of Chinese places in town and I gave up on a menu that seemed to me to be d�j� vu all over again). Now, in honor of a town celebration commemorating the anniversary of the dedication of the Statue of Liberty, a gift from France to the people of America, we'd decided to go with the Tricolor flow. French food, but not the fussy kind that's so off-putting to so many people. We were sticking with French country, French bistro. Delicious, accessible, and easy for a man like George to handle. Even if in his heart-of-fried-food hearts, he didn't want to.<br><br> I sloughed the thought aside and reminded Sophie, "There are tartines, too."<br><br> "Tartines." Her sigh hovered in the ether somewhere between Nirvana and Utopia. In the weeks since we'd started planning our French menu and I'd introduced her to tartines, she'd become something of an addict. And who could blame her?! The knife-and-fork open-faced French sandwiches are delightful.<br><br> "We're going to use some of the heirloom tomatoes still coming in from the local farmers," I told Sophie. "We'll put those on some of the tartines along with eggplant. Then for others, we've got ham and Gruy�re, and toasted Camembert, walnut, and fig."<br><br> "Walnut and fig."<br><br> I ignored George when he grunted.<br><br> "Now all we need . . ." I glanced at the quiches that looked decidedly naked. "Did Rocky say what time she'd be here with the herbs?"<br><br> "I'm late. I know. I'm sorry!"<br><br> For the second time in as many minutes, the kitchen door swung open and this time, Raquel Arnaud bumped into the room. Rocky was a friend of Sophie's, but there couldn't be two women who were more different. Sophie was short, plump, and as down-to-earth as her sensible shoes. Her hair was the same silvery color as Rocky's, but while Sophie's was short and shaggy, Rocky's was long and sleek and as glorious as the woman herself.<br><br> But then, Rocky had the whole French thing going for her, including just a trace of an accent that hadn't disappeared in spite of the fact that she'd left her native country nearly fifty years earlier.<br><br> Rocky was almost as tall as my five-nine, willowy, and as elegant as her clothing. She was a farmer&#x2014;herbs and specialty vegetables&#x2014;a woman whose life revolved around the seasons and the weather and the acreage thirty minutes outside of Hubbard where she grew some of the best produce in the state, yet anyone meeting her for the first time would think she'd just stepped out of the house to shop on the Rue de la Paix.<br><br> Well, except for that Friday night.<br><br> I did a double take.<br><br> That evening, graceful and refined Rocky looked . . .<br><br> She was wearing the black A-line dress she claimed was a fashion must, but Rocky's hair was uncombed and her lipstick was smudged. Sure, she was running late, and that might account for the slapdash grooming, but nothing I knew about Rocky could explain&#x2014;<br><br> Sneakers?<br><br> Before I came to Hubbard, I'd worked as a personal chef in Hollywood. Believe me, I knew fashion trends, fashion faux pas, and plain ol' fashion disasters.<br><br> I'd never known Raquel Arnaud to dare something as unfashionable and as downright un-French as to wear tennis shoes outside of the house. Especially ones that looked to be encrusted with a week's worth of garden goo.<br><br> "I knew I was running late so I chopped the thyme at home."<br><br> Before I could even think of what to say or how to ask Rocky if she'd completely lost her mind, she raced over and put a basket on the countertop beside me. There was a white linen towel thrown over the top of it and when Rocky whisked it away, I forgot all about her smeared lipstick and her tennis shoes.<br><br> But then, who can resist the heavenly woody/lemony aroma of fresh thyme?<br><br> I took a deep breath and automatically found myself smiling.<br><br> "Always has that effect on me, too." Rocky gave me a playful poke in the ribs at the same time she reached around me to sprinkle thyme on the quiches. "I brought griselles, too," she said. "But since you're already done with these, they'll have to wait for tomorrow's quiche."<br><br> I stepped back to admire the finished quiches. "Bacon, onion, and Swiss today," I told Rocky. "Pretty traditional, I know, but I thought that might be easiest if we get a crowd after the book signing. Tomorrow after the big parade, we'll mix it up with spinach and the shallots in some of the quiches." I peeked at the French shallots&#x2014;what Rocky called griselles&#x2014;and took another deep breath, and I swear, I could still smell the scent of autumn earth that clung to the shallots.<br><br> And to Rocky.<br><br> Carefully, I took another sniff.<br><br> A fragrant cloud of Chanel No. 5 usually enveloped Rocky.<br><br> That night, she smelled more like wet soil. And red wine.<br><br> Lots of red wine.<br><br> I guess Sophie noticed, too, because behind Rocky's back, she raised her eyebrows and gave me That Look. The one that said I was supposed to ask what the heck was going on.<br><br> Before I could, Rocky pulled a bottle of wine out of the basket she'd brought with her.<br><br> "We need to have a glass before we head out, eh?" She didn't wait for us to agree, but reached for the corkscrew she'd also brought along and opened the bottle. "You have glasses, George?" she asked, and since we didn't have a liquor license and there weren't any appropriate wineglasses around, he brought over water glasses. Four of them.<br><br> Rocky didn't mind sharing. She poured into each of the glasses and she was just about to take a drink when Sophie stopped her.<br><br> "What about a toast?" Sophie asked. "We always have a toast."<br><br> "Oh." As if this were a new thought, Rocky blinked and stared into her glass.<br><br> This time, Sophie augmented That Look with a scrunched-up nose and a tip of her head in Rocky's direction.<br><br> I knew a losing cause when I saw one.<br><br> I put a hand on Rocky's arm and couldn't help but notice that when I did, she flinched.<br><br> "Are you all right?" I asked. "You seem distracted."<br><br> She made a face that would have been convincing if I hadn't spent the last few years of my career as the personal chef of Hollywood megastar Meghan Cohan. I knew actors. Good actors. Bad actors. Rocky fell into the latter category.<br><br> "I get so flustered when I'm running late." I guess Rocky forgot all about the toast, because she downed her wine. "We should probably get going, huh? We don't want to miss the book signing."<br><br> "Imagine, Aurore Brisson here in Hubbard!" It looked as if Sophie knew a losing cause when she saw one, too, because she gave up on the toast, took a quick sip of wine, and set down her glass. She stepped up beside Rocky. "How exciting it must be for you to have a Frenchwoman here in town. And such a famous one! That book of hers&#x2014;"<br><br> "<i>Yesterday's Passion</i>. Yes, yes." Before Sophie could pilot her to the door, Rocky poured another glass of wine and slugged it down. "I'm anxious to read it. I've always been interested in my country's history but really, I don't know all that much about the Middle Ages. The story sounds so . . . so romantic. Knights, ladies, castles&#x2014;"<br><br> "And that gorgeous hunk, Sam Baker, who's going to play the lead role when the book's made into a TV series!" Sophie grinned and leaned closer to Rocky, speaking in a stage whisper I couldn't fail to hear. "Laurel knows him."<br><br> Rocky raised her eyebrows.<br><br> "Not well," I admitted because it was better than letting anyone know that Sam Baker had once had an affair with Meghan Cohan and had come on to me one morning while I was getting breakfast ready for the two of them down in the kitchen of Meghan's Malibu mansion. "We've met."<br><br> "Is he as gorgeous in person as he is in the movies?" Rocky asked.<br><br> He was, and I admitted it. Without adding that he was also a little too much into recreational drugs and other men's wives.<br><br> "It's only natural that he's playing the lead. Isn't that right, Laurel?" Sophie asked. "Meghan Cohan herself is producing and directing and starring. She's playing Cecile. The tabloids say they're having an affair, Meghan and Sam." Sophie paused, waiting for me to fill in the blanks. When I didn't, she breezed right on. "Oh, I can't wait to read the book and see the show and see if they stick to the original story. Is that how it works, Laurel? When they make a film or a TV show, do they usually stick to the original story?"<br><br> In this case, only if the original story involved late-night fights of epic proportions, accusations thrown back and forth like rocks from a catapult, and a huge and ugly breakup the tabloids had yet to get wind of. No doubt the network had squelched the truth to get as much mileage as they could out of what they were touting as both an on-screen and an offscreen romance.<br><br> "Well, I'm buying a copy of the book, that's for sure," Sophie told us. "And I can't wait to get Aurore Brisson's autograph. How clever it was of John and Mike over at the Book Nook to get her here just in time for the Statue of Liberty celebration. She's such a superstar, so young and pretty. I bet there will be a line out the door of the bookstore. Let's get over there fast."<br><br> <i>Fast</i>, of course, is a relative word when it comes to Sophie, who always has a patron to stop and say hello to or a neighbor to greet. Then, of course, there was the matter of Sophie's knee. Oh, she didn't move at a snail's pace because of that replacement surgery back in the spring. She'd recovered from that and gone through rehab and all was well. At least for a few weeks. That's when she twisted her knee. While she was on a Mediterranean cruise. On an island. Drinking ouzo and doing the <i>Zorba the Greek </i> dance with some hunky fisherman who emailed her regularly now and called her his little baklava and promised to come visit sometime soon.<br><br> To say this new injury annoyed me no end makes me look small-minded when, in fact, it makes sense that I'd be irritated. See, I had no intention of staying in Hubbard and I'd told Sophie that from the start. I promised I'd stay only until she felt better and could take over the management of the restaurant herself again.<br><br> Only that didn't look like it was going to happen anytime soon.<br><br> I held on to my temper along with the thought that this, too, would pass. And when it did . . .<br><br> We had just walked out the front door of the Terminal and a brisk autumn breeze ruffled my hair along with the French flag we were flying from a post out front, and I made sure to keep a smile off my face.<br><br> Sophie had an uncanny way of reading into my smiles, and for now, what I knew about how long I was staying and where I might be going when I waved adios to the town that time forgot was my business and mine alone.<br><br> We fell into step behind the throngs of people milling in front of the bookstore and slowly making themselves into some sort of orderly line, and while Sophie and Rocky chatted about people I didn't know, I had a few minutes to look around. What was now called the Traintown neighborhood had once been at the heart of Hubbard's industrial center. There were railroad tracks that ran along the back side of the restaurant and six times a day, a train still rumbled by and shook the Terminal to its nineteenth-century foundation. Across the tracks was a factory, long shuttered, just one of the many businesses that had gone south/closed their doors/given up the ghost in what had once been a vibrant community.</p><h2>The Contemporary History of Latin America (Latin America in Translation)</h2><p>For a quarter of a century, Tulio Halper�n Donghi's <i>Historia Contempor�nea de Am�rica Latina</i> has been the most influential and widely read general history of Latin America in the Spanish-speaking world.

Revised and updated by the author, superbly translated, this landmark of Latin American historiography will be accessible to an entirely new readership. <br>Beginning with a survey of the late colonial landscape, <i>The Contemporary History of Latin America </i>traces the social, economic, and political development of the region to the late twentieth century, with special emphasis on the period since 1930. Chapters are organized chronologically, each beginning with a general description of social and economic developments in Latin America generally, followed by specific attention to political matters in each country. What emerges is a well-rounded and detailed picture of the forces at work throughout Latin American history.<br>This book will be of great interest to all those seeking a general overview of modern Latin American history, and its distinctive Latin American voice will enhance its significance for all students of Latin American history.</p><p>&#34;The translation of this classic work is long overdue.

Chinese verse is supposedly cool and distant, detached and dispassionate.

Included here are samplings from the legendary earliest poetry of courtesans, palace women, and Tao priestesses to works by contemporary Chinese women living in both the East and West.

Search no further." --Martin Amis, <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i><p> Originally published in 1953, Saul Bellow's modern picaresque tale grandly illustrates twentieth-century man's restless pursuit of an elusive meaning. Augie March, a young man growing up in Chicago during the Great Depression, doesn't understand success on other people's terms. Fleeing to Mexico in search of something to fill his restless soul and soothe his hunger for adventure, Augie latches on to a wild succession of occupations until his journey brings him full circle. Yet beneath Augie's carefree nature lies a reflective person with a strong sense of responsibility to both himself and others, who in the end achieves a success of his own making. A modern-day Columbus, Augie March is a man searching not for land but for self and soul and, ultimately, for his place in the world.</p><p> "A book of extraordinary and massive power ... plainly one of the richest of twentieth-century American novels." --Alfred Kazin</p><p> "[Bellow's] body of work is more capacious of imagination and language than anyone else's.... If there's a candidate for the great American novel, I think this is it." --Salman Rushdie, <i>The Sunday Times</i> (London)</p><p> "The best postwar American novel, <i>The Adventures of Augie March</i> magnificently terminates and fulfills the line of Melville, Twain, and Whitman." --James Wood, <i>The New Republic</i></p><p><b>Saul Bellow&nbsp;</b>was praised for his vision, his ear for detail, his humor, and the masterful artistry of his prose. Born of Russian Jewish parents in Lachine, Quebec in 1915, he was raised in Chicago.

Then the victim walked into town.<br><br>Behind the picture-postcard fa�ade of Kingsmarkham lies a community rife with violence, betrayal, and a taste for vengeance. When sixteen-year-old Lizzie Cromwell reappears no one knows where she has been, including Lizzie herself. Inspector Wexford thinks she was with a boyfriend. But the disappearance of a three-year-old girl casts a more ominous light on events. And when the public's outrage turns toward a recently released pederast and another suspect turns up stabbed to death, Wexford must try to unravel the mystery before any more bodies appear, and before a mob of local vigilantes metes out a rough justice to their least favorite suspect. In <b>Harm Done</b>, the violence is near at hand, and evil lies just a few doors down the block.</p><p>In <i>Harm Done</i>, Rendell has added a remarkable strand of acute social commentary to a book that still functions as an utterly compelling piece of detective fiction. In exploring the controversial subject of pedophilia, she takes the mainstay of her work--the problems of modern life--to a level of passion and commitment that gives the book a truly powerful underpinning.<p> Back in the familiar Sussex town of Kingsmarkham, Rendell's dogged sleuth Wexford is investigating the strange abductions of two young girls: Rachel, a bright middle-class student, and Lizzie, a mentally disabled 16-year-old living with her unsympathetic parents on a grim council estate. When both girls return home, apparently unharmed, Wexford is faced with a curious mystery: what really happened to them? As Wexford begins to uncover the disturbing truth, the dark psychological world that Rendell is so adroit at exploring suddenly comes into focus. And her gift for sharp but concise characterization remains untouchable, as in the case of a reluctant witness: '''We don't talk about that sort of thing.' She very nearly but not quite tossed her head." <i>--Barry Forshaw, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>10 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Death of an Honest Man (A Hamish Macbeth Mystery, 33)</h2><p><b>Sergeant Hamish Macbeth--Scotland's most quick-witted but unambitious policeman--returns in this <i>New York Times </i>bestselling mystery series from the creator of Agatha Raisin. </b><br><br>Nobody loves an honest man--or that was what police sergeant Hamish Macbeth <i>tried </i>to tell newcomer Paul English.

He told Jessie Currie--who compulsively repeats all the last words of her twin sister--that she needed psychiatric help.<br><br>"I speak as I find," he bragged.

The young woman was wildly beautiful in a dark, unconventional way, and her personality and way of life matched. She gazed at it for long, silent minutes in wonder. It was without doubt the biggest cock she had ever seen. Her eyes actually dilated with pleasure as she closed them and reopened them slowly to make sure she hadn&#x2019;t imagined its great size. Pleased beyond belief that she would soon possess it, she licked her lips in anticipation.<br> &nbsp;<br> Truly it was a magnificent specimen. She held her body perfectly still and coaxed him with a soft, seductive voice. &#x201c;Come, my big boy, another few inches and you are mine. Don&#x2019;t be shy, don&#x2019;t retreat, after all &#x2019;tis only a little sin I&#x2019;m committing,&#x201d; she whispered coaxingly. &#x201c;Our chance encounter will soon be consummated,&#x201d; she soothed with confidence.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a very big cock&#x2014;I hope you fit&#x2014;never mind, I&#x2019;ll cram you in somehow,&#x201d; she said under her breath. She begged prettily, &#x201c;If I reach out my hand, will you let me touch you, stroke you?&#x201d; Better not, she thought as he looked ready to bolt.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now she was face-to-face with the act, she wondered wildly if she could go through with it. She&#x2019;d never done it before, although she had contemplated it for weeks, but she knew after this time she would probably do it again and again. For a moment its size frightened her. What if it hurt her? It could probably do her irreparable damage given half a chance. She pushed her fear to the back of her mind, took a deep breath, and plunged upon it.<br> &nbsp;<br> The fat rooster squawked so loudly and flapped his black wings so frantically that she almost lost it, but the fierce hunger in her belly made her hang on determinedly. Then she closed her eyes tightly and wrung its neck until it was very, very dead.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lady Summer St. Catherine had an abundance of jet black, shining hair which fell heavily below her shoulders and curled on the ends into great natural ringlets. Her black-fringed eyes were a changeable shade of hazel, sometimes soft brown, more often leaf green and they were tip-tilted at the corners giving credence to her nickname, Cat, which she preferred because she felt her full name to be laughably pretentious. Her mouth was wide and capable of a sulky pout, a firm-lipped determination, or a dazzling laugh, but it was as red as crushed strawberries. Her skin was the color of rich Devon cream, a vivid contrast to her billowing cloud of jet black tresses.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cat was slender and long-legged as a colt with small, high up-thrusting breasts which strained the laces on the too-tight boy&#x2019;s shirt she wore. She also had on a pair of ragged knee breeches and scuffed boots which her young brother Viscount Spencer had outgrown.<br> &nbsp;<br> Viscount Spencer St. Catherine also hated his name and answered only to Spider. The Cornwall estate where they lived was called Roseland, and though it stood on five acres with a once-splendid manor house, it could not boast of one servant or gardener and had an overgrown, unkempt air of neglect. Cat&#x2019;s mother was dead, her father alive, and she fervently wished it was the other way about since she had nothing but hatred for her father. He was and always had been a selfish, ruthless drunken swine who indulged every vice known to man.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her mother had died giving birth to Spencer when Cat was only three. Years later, she&#x2019;d learned through servants&#x2019; gossip that her mother had almost died when she was born and the doctor had told Randal St. Catherine in no uncertain terms that another child would kill her.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The useless brat&#x2019;s a girl!&#x201d; he had raved. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll not stop trying till she gives me a son.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;&#x2019;Twould be deliberate murder, Randal, if she conceives again,&#x201d; the doctor had warned.<br> &nbsp;<br> St. Catherine shrugged. &#x201c;Then I&#x2019;ll be free to take a new wife&#x2014;a younger, healthier woman to satisfy me in bed.&#x201d; But by the time his wife had given him his son and conveniently departed for heaven, the arrogant St. Catherine&#x2019;s world had been turned upside down by civil war. Parliament had decided to run the country with Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s heavy hand at the helm. St. Catherine found it expedient to turn his coat, for being loyal to the old King could get your lands and money confiscated and it became a crime to be a member of the aristocracy.<br> &nbsp;<br> So he had paid lip service to the austere &#x201c;new order&#x201d; which banned drinking, whoring, and gambling along with every other vice designed to make a gentleman&#x2019;s life tolerable. It didn&#x2019;t take many years for this new order to become tarnished, for Englishmen soon realized they had gone from bad to worse. With sinking trade and bad harvests, men everywhere were poorer with long unhappy faces atop their dull, worsted garments. The larger cities and towns were filled with Cromwell&#x2019;s spies and a breath of protest could carry you off to prison. Cornishmen were not quite as docile as the rest of the English, and while the ones with honor and integrity such as the Grenviles and Helfords risked their wealth and their lives to help restore the Stuarts to the throne, others such as St. Catherine took advantage of their isolated estates to further their own ends.<br> &nbsp;<br> Roseland became no better than a gaming hell where forbidden cards, dice, and liquor became the order of the day. St. Catherine did not play on the square and soon cheating at cards became second nature even to his children.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1660 when Charles II was joyously embraced by one and all, St. Catherine was no exception. He took himself off to London and for the past few years had been slowly devoured by the dissolute life of the wicked city. The only reason he ever returned to Rose-land was to denude its walls of its valuable paintings or sell off the last of the horses.<br> &nbsp;<br> The last time he&#x2019;d been home four months since, Cat had removed her beloved black Ebony from the stables and stayed out all night with him. Finally, Rancid, as she called her father, had driven off in a rage, cursing the young hellcat to perdition, and taking all of his servants with him.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cat made her way through the tangled overgrown estate which bordered the well-kept lands of the Helfords. She had only actually trespassed once on the magnificent Helford estate. The night she had protected Ebony she had ridden him onto the broad acres attached to Helford Hall and hidden in one of the many yew glades which were part of the formal gardens. The clipped yews formed high dark walls which kept out even sunlight and would be cool on the hottest days. Deep within the mile of yew walks it was remote, silent, and more than a little eerie, almost threatening.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Helford estate boasted over five hundred acres, but these ran back from the seacoast along the Helford River right up to the town of Helston. The house itself stood atop the cliff&#x2019;s edge like Roseland, but they were over a mile apart and only Helford Hall&#x2019;s clustered chimneys, turrets, obelisks, and widow&#x2019;s walk were visible from the St. Catherine property. Of course they were only visible when the coast was free from heavy fog or sea mists.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cat hummed a tune to herself as she strode along, swinging the large rooster by its feet. As she neared the house she waved gaily to her brother and called, &#x201c;Spider, did you manage to get the eggs?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> At sight of her he stopped dead in his tracks, a black scowl descending like thunder upon his brow. &#x201c;Hell and damnation, Cat, you send me to steal eggs, a job any five-year-old could manage, while you sneak off to throttle a cock!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She sighed, knowing his male vanity had been injured. &#x201c;Spider, I swear to God he walked right through a hole in the fence, straight into my path. I damned near tripped over him. What did you expect me to do? Ask him to hang about while I ran off to look for you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;All the same,&#x201d; he said grudgingly, &#x201c;butchering is no job for a lady.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She nodded solemnly, &#x201c;Fowl play.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He broke into a grin. &#x201c;Christ, it&#x2019;s a big bugger. I bet it put up a hell of a squawk.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She laughed now, remembering. &#x201c;I thought the bloody gamekeeper would come running. Still, I was ready to defy him if he had. Possession is nine-tenths of the law and the cock was on our land.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Spider said, &#x201c;That bastard is the reason there are no rabbits left for me to snare. Can&#x2019;t have rabbits nibbling precious Helford shrubbery.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> They made straight for the kitchen door. Roseland was a picture at this time of the year. Its soft red-brick walls were covered with flowering vines. Honeysuckle had overgrown each arched doorway and early pink roses and spring violets vied with a sea of daffodils which spread out under the fruit trees now covered in blossom. The lawns in close to the house were a lush green and looked well tended, but that was only because she tethered her horse Ebony and Spider&#x2019;s pony there so they could crop it. They had no oats or fodder for their animals and so the thick green lawns must suffice.<br> &nbsp;<br> At the back of the house Cat always planted a kitchen garden, for they relied upon the vegetables she grew to keep them alive. They had used up all last autumn&#x2019;s harvest as well as the last of the apples. This time of year the gardens were very pretty but pretty didn&#x2019;t fill your belly. The only things that were big enough to eat were young green onions and a few new potatoes no bigger than marbles. Cat sighed as she put water on the fire to boil. First she&#x2019;d have to pluck the cockerel, then clean it, long before the savory smell of the cooking bird would permeate the corners of the kitchen.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Draw Your Weapons</h2><p><b>A single book might not change the world. But this utterly original meditation on art and war might transform the way you <i>see</i> the world&#x2014;and that makes all the difference.</b><br><br> <i>&#x201c;How to live in the face of so much suffering? What difference can one person make in this beautiful, imperfect, and imperiled world?&#x201d;</i><br><br> Through a dazzling combination of memoir, history, reporting, visual culture, literature, and theology, Sarah Sentilles offers an impassioned defense of life lived by peace and principle. It is a literary collage with an urgent hope at its core: that art might offer tools for remaking the world.<br><br> In <i>Draw Your Weapons,</i> Sentilles tells the true stories of Howard, a conscientious objector during World War II, and Miles, a former prison guard at Abu Ghraib, and in the process she challenges conventional thinking about how war is waged, witnessed, and resisted. The pacifist and the soldier both create art in response to war: Howard builds a violin; Miles paints portraits of detainees. With echoes of Susan Sontag and Maggie&nbsp;Nelson, Sentilles investigates images of violence from the era of slavery to the drone age. In doing so, she wrestles with some of our most profound questions: What does it take to inspire compassion? What impact can one person have? How should we respond to violence when it feels like it can&#x2019;t be stopped?<br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Draw Your Weapons</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A collage of death, savagery, torture, and trauma across generations and continents, Sarah Sentilles&#x2019;s <i>Draw Your Weap</i>ons is painful to read, hard to put down, and impossible to forget.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>O: The Oprah Magazine</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;In her dynamic, impressionistic (and cleverly titled) book, Sentilles focuses on language and images&#x2013;particularly photography&#x2013;and considers what role they play in peace and war. Eschewing a traditional narrative, Sentilles focuses on two men&#x2013;one a World War II conscience objector who makes violins, and the other an Abu Ghraib prison guard who paints detainee portraits. In brief, delicately layered pieces rather than a narrative, Sentilles has created a collage that explores art, violence, and what it means to live a principled life.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The National Book Review</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the kind of book that, after reading just half, you have to stop and catch your breath, because reading it changes you, not just in terms of what you know&#x2013;it changes the way you think and how you feel&#x2013;so much so that, halfway in, I wanted to go back and start again because I felt I was already a different person to the person I was when I began.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Turnaround</i></b></p><p><b>Sarah Sentilles </b>is the author of <i>Breaking Up with God, A Church of Her Own, </i>and <i>Taught by America</i>.

He laughs, luminous, looks right at the camera, violin in one hand and bow in the other, a blue-�and-�gray plaid shirt, a gold wedding ring lit up by the flash. His hair, what&#x2019;s left of it, white.<br><br>It was Howard Scott&#x2019;s eighty-�seventh birthday, the newspaper story said. His family threw a party at the assisted-�care facility where he lived in Lacey, Washington. His children, grandchildren, and great-�grandchildren came to celebrate. They sang. He blew out candles. Everyone ate cake.<br><br>We have a surprise for you, his grandson said, and handed him an instrument case. Inside was the violin. Not just any violin, mind you, I read in the paper, but a violin 60 years in the making.<br><br>���<br><br>To make a violin, you need horses. You need elephants, cattle, tortoises, snakes, abalone, whales. You need lambs fed on dry mountainous pasture. You need mastodons dug from arctic ice. You need trees felled in winter when their trunks are free of sap, trees grown on a forest&#x2019;s south side in stony soil with little water so they mature slowly, their trunks strong and branchless.<br><br>To make a violin, you need war. It is said Antonio Stradivari&#x2019;s most beautiful instruments were built of maple sent from Turkey to Italy, intended for oars that would row Italian warships. Because they were often at war with the Italians, the Turks sent wood with uneven grain, wood they knew would crack and split under the weight of water, but when Stradivari saw the curved wood, he knew he could make it sing.<br><br>���<br><br>People used to believe photographs captured something material from the person standing in front of the camera. They thought it worked like this: sunlight bounced off the body and onto the photographic plate, and when that light traveled from body to plate, it carried a physical element with it, a trace, however small.<br><br>Photographs were like icons, they thought, like the story about the woman so moved by the sight of Jesus falling under the weight of the cross he was carrying to Golgotha that she pushed through the crowd, past Roman soldiers, to reach him. With her veil, she wiped Jesus&#x2019;s face. Some call her Veronica, a name that comes from the Latin words vera (true) and icon (image), because in return for her tenderness, Jesus granted her a portrait: on that cloth, in blood and sweat, she found an imprint of his face.<br><br>���<br><br>I called information and asked for the telephone number of a man named Howard Scott in Lacey, Washington. Hold please, the operator said, and then a recorded voice told me his number. I dialed. The phone rang. A man answered.<br><br>I read about you in the paper, I said.<br><br>Don&#x2019;t believe everything you read about me, he said.<br><br>I told him my name, explained why I was calling, asked if it might be okay for me to write about him.<br><br>Yes, he said. Are you one of my students?<br><br>No, I said.<br><br>I was also in Vietnam, he said.<br><br>Something wasn&#x2019;t quite right, but I couldn&#x2019;t put my finger on it.<br><br>I&#x2019;ll send you a letter, I said. I&#x2019;ll give you time to think about it.<br><br>I hung up the phone and wrote him a letter. I put it in the mail.<br><br>I waited for weeks, months. No response. I worried Howard had died. I called the number again. The phone rang and rang.<br><br>���<br><br>The artist Ann Hamilton held a canister containing a strip of film inside her mouth and used her lips as an aperture to create each exposure&#x2014;�a mouth-�held pinhole camera. To take a photograph of another person, she stood facing her subject, less than a foot away, her mouth open, both people looking at each other, nothing between them, just Hamilton&#x2019;s open mouth. She said she wanted the part of her body where all song exists to also become her eye.<br><br>���<br><br>I had nearly forgotten about the picture of Howard and the violin, about the letter I sent, about wanting to write about him, but then I heard a message on my phone from Kayleen Pritchard, Howard&#x2019;s daughter.<br><br>Kayleen told me she&#x2019;d just found my letter on her father&#x2019;s desk, buried in a stack of papers. She called right away.<br><br>Months ago, she&#x2019;d been going through boxes of her parents&#x2019; files and letters. They&#x2019;d saved everything. Ration stamps. Brochures. Newspaper articles. Letters to the editor. Her mother, Ruane, had died a few years back, and Kayleen wanted to put her parents&#x2019; things in order, tell their story before it was too late, but she felt overwhelmed. I said to the universe, I need someone to help me, she told me. I need someone to write a book about this.<br><br>That was on May 25, Kayleen said on the phone. The same day you wrote your letter. Come see us.<br><br>���<br><br>It is a mistake to associate photography with darkness, Roland Barthes wrote. It should be named not camera obscura but camera lucida, camera of light.<br><br>���<br><br>When Kayleen called, I was living in Idaho with my husband, Eric, surviving on a dissertation fellowship and student loans. Through the window above my desk I could see the Boulder Mountains and hillsides covered in sage. For one week in late winter, an elk slept on the front porch of our house, curled up like a cat.<br><br>I flew to Seattle, took a taxi to the ferry landing, boarded a ferry to Bainbridge Island.<br><br>I walked down the dock and Kayleen and I recognized each other from the descriptions we&#x2019;d given over the phone. We hugged and laughed and loaded my suitcase into the trunk of her car. We drove to Indianola, where Kayleen lives with her husband, Paul.<br><br>They&#x2019;d recently moved into a small house a block from the water. Their old house had felt too big, and they&#x2019;d wanted to downsize&#x2014;�right-�size, she called it. After the realtor showed her the house, she walked along the beach and collected sea glass. She found eight pieces of agate and counted it a good omen.<br><br>Kayleen turned the car into the driveway and parked. Their house looked so familiar I felt I&#x2019;d seen it before, which was impossible, because I&#x2019;d never been to Indianola in my life. But then I remembered a meditation a friend of mine had led me through years earlier. In the meditation, my thirty-�something self met my old-�woman self inside a cabin in the woods, its walls lined with books, a long desk in the middle of the room. Follow the writing, my old-�woman self said when I asked her what I needed to know. Her writing cabin in the meditation looked exactly like Kayleen and Paul&#x2019;s house.<br><br>Kayleen led me inside. The front door opened into a room with built-�in benches and soft cushions, a kitchen with a stovetop and oven and counter and sink, a woodstove, a table for four, a reading chair, a ladder to the loft where Kayleen and Paul sleep. This is it, she said. Home. Now let me show you the studio.<br><br>Trees with trunks wrapped in white lights lined the path between the house and the studio. On the right side of the garage, a door, and inside, stairs. At the top of the stairs, a side table covered with family photographs, arranged like an altar, electric tea lights in front of the pictures so they glowed.<br><br>Make yourself at home, Kayleen said. Dinner&#x2019;s at six, but come to the house whenever you&#x2019;re ready. She walked down the stairs. I heard the door open and close, and then I was alone in Indianola, staying in the home of the daughter of a man whose photograph I saw in the newspaper, a stranger who didn&#x2019;t feel like a stranger at all.<br><br>���<br><br>Faces in photographs endure, and they instruct, Alex Danchev wrote. They tell us about themselves, and they tell us about ourselves&#x2014;�who we are, and who we may become; what we are, and what we are capable of.<br><br>���<br><br>Just talking with him, you might not know there&#x2019;s anything wrong, Kayleen said as we drove to see Howard the next morning. Red-�tailed hawks floated over the tall trees lining the highway. If there had been no clouds, we would have been able to see Mount Rainier.<br><br>He&#x2019;s delightful, lucid, entertaining, she said. He tells wonderful stories. About Ruane. About their decision to get married. About getting his doctorate in education. About teaching at the university. About protesting war. But if you stay with him long enough, he&#x2019;ll tell you the same stories again, as if it&#x2019;s the first time he&#x2019;s told them.<br><br>He wants to know when he repeats himself, Kayleen said. The nurses don&#x2019;t tell him, and it scares him to think people would believe his mind is so far gone he wouldn&#x2019;t want to know, scares him to think you&#x2019;d listen and pretend his words are new.<br><br>After her mother died, Kayleen drove the ninety miles between her home and Howard&#x2019;s three times a week to be with her dad. Sometimes a barred owl crossed the highway in front of her car, its wings wide. She watched the changes in Mount Rainier&#x2014;�light, clouds, snow&#x2014;�and felt the mountain guide her. It&#x2019;s where their ashes will go, she told me. They wanted to be together.<br><br>Kayleen didn&#x2019;t like the place where Howard was living. Too institutional. Concrete-�block walls. Long hallways. They moved the dining room from the first floor to the basement and then blamed Howard for not being able to find his way to dinner. Howard didn&#x2019;t feel comfortable there. He worried people were taking his things. Kayleen didn&#x2019;t know if he was right to be worried or if he was paranoid.<br><br>When I told him you were coming, he was excited, she said. He feels like what he did made no difference, like he&#x2019;s been forgotten.<br><br>���<br><br>The word lost comes from the Old Norse word los, meaning the disbanding of an army, Rebecca Solnit wrote.

Still others said the first music made with a string was the ping of a hunter&#x2019;s bow, the sound so disturbing to the quiet he was trying to keep while tracking his prey, and so surprisingly sweet, that the hunter put down the bow, unable to use it to kill another living thing.<br><br>���<br><br>Kayleen and I walked down the hallway of identical doors and knocked on the one with a sign next to it that read, dr. howard scott.

This is the first book of its kind meant to help Protestant Christians recognize the early church fathers as an essential part of their faith. Writing primarily to the evangelical, independent, and free church communities, who remain largely suspicious of church history and the relationship between Scripture and tradition, D. H. Williams clearly explains why every branch of today&#39;s church owes its heritage to the doctrinal foundation laid by postapostolic Christianity. Based on solid historical scholarship, this volume shows that embracing the &#34;catholic&#34; roots of the faith will not lead to the loss of Protestant distinctiveness but is essential for preserving the Christian vision in our rapidly changing world.</p><p>Williams is assistant professor of patristics and historical theology, Loyola University of Chicago.</p><h2>How We Lived Then: A History of Everyday Life During the Second World War</h2><p>Compiled by the historical adviser to the TV series "The 1940s House," this is an engagingly written social chronicle of wartime civilian life in England from September 1939 to August 1945&#x2014;from the grandeurs of the Blitz to the miseries of dried egg powder&#x2014;with numerous individual testimonies.</p><p>A fascinating and highly readable book on a subject commanding strong popular interest, filled with personal testimonies and colourful details.Norman Longmate served in the army in World War II, and then went to Oxford University in 1947 to read Modern History.

She feels the epic trek she takes several times a day from her office to her coffee maker is a true example of her pioneer spirit.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p>Connor Garrett was a grown-ass man. He knew there was nothing to fear in sleep. He knew the darkness of his room didn't hide anything more sinister than a pair of carelessly discarded cowboy boots, waiting for him to stub his toe on them in the dead of night during a sleepy trip to the bathroom.<br><br>He knew these things, just like he knew the sun would rise over the mountains just before six this time of year, whether he wanted it to or not. He knew these things as surely as he knew that an early-morning breeze tinged with salt meant a storm would blow in from the coast later. That unintentional run-ins with barbed-wire fences burned like a son of a bitch. That wooden barns burned and people you loved left.<br><br>Yeah, he knew all that.<br><br>But it didn't stop him from waking up most nights in a cold sweat, his heart pounding harder than a spooked horse's hooves on arena dirt.<br><br>Because the simple truth was that Connor Garrett knew all these things, but his subconscious had yet to catch up.<br><br>He sat bolt upright in bed, sweat beading on his bare chest and his forehead. If this weren't standard procedure for his body, he might've been concerned he was having a heart attack. Unfortunately, though, he knew at this point that the racing heart, accompanied by chest pain, was just stress. Anxiety.<br><br>Damn lingering grief that refused to lessen even as the years passed.<br><br>He wasn't surprised when he woke up alone in bed, not anymore. It had been three years, after all. He wasn't surprised, but he <em>noticed.</em> Every time. Was acutely aware of how cold the sheets were on her side of the bed. It wasn't even the same bed he'd slept in with Jessie. He'd bought a new one about a year ago because continuing to sleep in the bed they'd shared had seemed too depressing. But it hadn't accomplished what he had hoped it might.<br><br>Because no matter how hard he tried, whether he lay down in the middle of the bed at the start of the night, or even on the side nearest to the window, he always ended up on <em>his</em> side.<br><br>The side by the door. In case of intruders or any other danger. The side that allowed him to protect the person sleeping next to him. The side he had taken every night during his eight years of marriage. It was as if his late wife's ghost was rolling him over in his sleep.<br><br>And then waking him up.<br><br>Unfortunately, Jessie didn't even have the decency to haunt him. She was just gone. And in her place was emptiness. Emptiness in his bed. In his house. In his chest.<br><br>And when his chest wasn't empty, it was filled with pain and a kind of dread that took over his whole body and made it impossible to breathe. Like now.<br><br>He swung his legs over the side of the mattress, the wood floor cold beneath his bare feet. He stood and walked over to the window, looked out into the darkness. The black shadows of pine trees filled his vision, and beyond that, the darker silhouette of the mountains, backlit by a slightly grayer sky. And down to the left he could barely make out the front porch. And the golden glow of the porch light that he'd somehow managed to leave on before he'd gone to sleep.<br><br>His chest tightened. That was probably why he'd woken up.<br><br>Abruptly, the dream he'd been having flooded back through his mind. It hadn't been a full dream so much as images.<br><br>Opening the door late at night to see Eli standing there, his brother's face grim, bleaker than Connor had ever seen it. And a ring of gold light from the porch had shone around him. Made him look like an angel of some kind. An angel of death, it had turned out.<br><br>As stupid as it was, he was half convinced that leaving that same light on downstairs brought the dreams back stronger.<br><br>It didn't make sense. But if there was one thing he'd learned over the years, it was that grief didn't make a lick of sense.<br><br>He jerked the bedroom door open and walked downstairs, heading toward the entryway. He stood there in front of the door, looking at the porch light shining through the windows. For a second he had the thought that if he opened it, he would find Eli standing there. Would find himself transported back in time three years. Listening to the kind of news that no one should have to hear.<br><br>There was a reason his darkest nightmares consisted of nothing more than his younger brother standing on his front porch.<br><br>Because in that moment his life had transformed into a nightmare. There was nothing scarier than that. He was confident he could take the bogeyman if need be. But he couldn't fight death.<br><br>And in the end he hadn't been able to save Jessie.<br><br>And he was not opening the damn door.<br><br>He flipped the light off and found himself walking into the kitchen and opening the fridge, rather than going back upstairs. He looked at the beer, which was currently the only thing on the shelves besides a bottle of ketchup and a bag that had an onion in it that had probably been there since the beginning of summer.<br><br>He let out a heavy sigh and shut the fridge. He should not drink beer at three in the morning.<br><br>Three in the morning was clearly Jack Daniel's o'clock.<br><br>He walked over to the cabinet where he kept the harder stuff and pulled out his bottle of Jack. It was almost gone. And no one was here. No one was here, because his fucking house was empty. Because he was alone.<br><br>Considering those things, he decided to hell with the glass. He picked up the bottle and tipped it back, barely even feeling the burn anymore as the alcohol slid down his throat.<br><br>Maybe now he would be able to get some sleep. Maybe for a few hours he could forget.<br><br>He'd given up on getting rest years ago. These days he just settled for oblivion.<br><br>And this was the fastest way he knew to get it.<br><br>"You should just install a drain in the house so you can hose it down and let all the dirt wash out. Just like you do out in the barn."<br><br>"What the hell are you doing here, Liss?"<br><br>Felicity Foster refused to be cowed by the overwhelmingly unfriendly greeting her best friend had just issued. It was just Connor, after all. She was used to his less than sparkly demeanor. She was also used to finding him passed out on the couch in the morning.<br><br>It would be nice if that occurred less frequently, but if anything, he seemed to be getting worse.<br><br>Not that she could blame <em>him.</em> She blamed his barn burning down. As far as the loss of Jessie was concerned, things might have continued to get better had he not lost that, too. It was just a building, bricks and wood, but it was his livelihood. It was just another piece of Connor's dream burned down to the ground. He'd had enough of that. Too much of it.<br><br>She was officially pissed at life on his behalf. How much was one man supposed to endure?<br><br>"And to answer your rather charming question, Connor," she said, stepping nearer to the couch, "I brought you groceries."<br><br>He sat up, his face contorting, making him look a bit like he'd swallowed a porcupine. "Groceries? Why did you do that?"<br><br>"I know it's been a while since you've gone out and socialized with actual people, rather than simply sharing your space with cows, so I feel compelled to remind you that the normal human response to this would be <em>thank you!''</em><br><br>He swung his legs over the side of the couch and rubbed his hand over his face. She wanted to do something. To put her hand on his back and offer comfort. She was used to those kinds of impulses around Connor. She'd been fighting them for the better part of her adult life. But her conclusion was always that touching him would be a bad idea. So she stood there, her hands held awkwardly at her sides, leaving him uncomforted. Leaving the appropriate amount of space between them.<br><br>That was part of being a good friend. At least, it was part of maintaining a healthy friendship as far as she and Connor were concerned.<br><br>"Thank you," he said, his voice gruff. "But why the hell did you bring me groceries? And why did you bring them by before work?"<br><br>"I brought you groceries because man cannot live on booze alone. I'm bringing them this morning because I was too tired to lug them over last night, when I actually bought them. So I thought, in the spirit of goodwill and breakfast cereals, I would bring them by now."<br><br>"I do like breakfast cereals. I'm ambivalent about goodwill." He stood up, wobbling slightly. "Feeling a little bit ambivalent about gravity, too."<br><br>"I'm surprised you feel like eating. How much did you drink?"<br><br>He looked away from her and shrugged in a classically Connor manner. Playing things off was an art form with this man. "I don't know. I woke up in the middle of the night. I couldn't get back to sleep so I had a little bit to drink and ended up staying down here. Anyway, I don't really notice the hangovers anymore."<br><br>"I don't think building up a resistance to hangovers is a crowning achievement."<br><br>"For my lifestyle, it certainly is."<br><br>She rolled her eyes. "Come on, cowboy. I'll pour you some cereal."<br><br>She shouldn't offer to do things like that for him. She knew it. But she did it anyway. Just like she brought his groceries when she knew his fridge contained nothing but beer. Just like she still came to his house every day to make sure he was taken care of.<br><br>"Whoa, wait a second, Liss. We do not know each other well enough for that shit."<br><br>"I've known you since I was fifteen."<br><br>"The preparation of cereal is a highly contentious thing. You don't know how much milk I might want. Hell, I don't know how much milk I might want until I assess the density and quality of the cereal."<br><br>"Are you still drunk?"<br><br>"Probably a little bit."<br><br>"Kitchen. Now."<br><br>Connor offered her a smart-ass smile, one side of his mouth curving upward. She couldn't help but watch him as he walked from the living room into the kitchen. His dark hair was longer than he used to keep it, a beard now covering his once clean-shaven jaw. She didn't mind the look. Actually, <em>didn't mind</em> was an understatement; she thought he looked dead sexy. Though, in her opinion, there was no look Connor had ever sported that she'd found less than sexy. Even that terrible haircut, gelled and spiked up, that he'd had for about a year in high school, his one and only attempt at trendiness. No, on that score, the beard and hair were fine. The real issue was that his mountain-man look wasn't a fashion statement, but an outward sign of the fact that he just didn't take care of himself anymore.<br><br>They walked into the kitchen, and with the sun shining through the window like it was now, she could clearly see the coat of neglect that everything wore. The stove had a grease film over the top of it, a shocking amount of splatters on the white surface considering that she knew Connor never cooked anything here beyond frozen pizza. The pine cabinets looked dingy, the front window dotted with a white film of hard-water stains.<br><br>The house didn't wear its neglect with quite the same devilish flare its owner did.<br><br>Connor reached up and opened one of the cabinets, taking out one of the brightly colored boxes of cereal she had just placed there. It struck her, in that moment, how funny it was she had known exactly where to put the cereal, and that he had known she would.<br><br>He grabbed a bowl and placed it on the counter, turning to face her, and she realized then that Connor wasn't wearing his neglect quite as well as he would like everyone to believe. Sure, he was still sexy as hell, the tight lines by his eyes, the deep grooves in his forehead not doing anything to diminish that. But they were new. A map of the stress and grief of the past few years, deepened by his recent losses.<br><br>She ached for him. But beyond buying the man's food, there was very little she could do.<br><br>She had been about to unload on him about all the crap that was happening with her rental. But it wasn't a good time. Though she doubted with Connor there was ever a good time. Not because he wouldn't care, but because she didn't want to pile on.<br><br>Connor poured milk on his cereal, milk she had brought, and set it back on the counter. He picked up his bowl and started eating, crunching loudly on his first bite. "Are you going to have some, Liss?"<br><br>"I never say no to cereal. I have important accounting stuff to attend to. I find an early-morning carb rush is the best way to handle that."<br><br>"Coffee?" he asked, talking around the food in his mouth.<br><br>"I had a carafe before I came over. I don't play around with caffeine consumption."<br><br>"Well, I need some." He set the bowl back down on the counter and made his way over to the coffeemaker.<br><br>"So you had coffee. Beer, and coffee."<br><br>"I'm not an animal."<br><br>Liss snickered while she got her own bowl and set about preparing her cereal. There was a strange domesticity to the scene. Mundane conversation, easy morning sounds. Water running in the sink, clattering dishes. The soft filter of early sunlight through the thick wall of evergreens that surrounded Connor's front yard.<br><br>There was something poignant about sharing this with him. This moment that seemed to have slipped right out of time. Like something she'd stolen, something she shouldn't have.<br><br>Seriously, you would think she was the one who had been drinking. She was maudlin.<br><br>Connor started the coffee then returned to the island where he'd prepared his cereal. They stood across from each other, eating in silence, except for the crunching. And the sounds of the coffeemaker.<br><br>More morning sounds she was not entitled to.<br><br>Because this was the kind of thing a guy shared with his lover or wife. Not with his oddly codependent best friend.<br><br>"Have you heard back from the insurance company about the settlement?" The barn had burned down in July thanks to a few kids carelessly playing with fireworks, and while Liss knew that insurance companies could drag their feet to a pretty insane degree, this was going somewhere beyond that.<br><br>It was mid-September, and as far as she knew, Connor's bank account remained void of settlements.<br><br>"Nope."<br><br>"Well, that's a little bit ridiculous, don't you think?"<br><br>He shrugged one shoulder then took another bite of cereal. "Probably. Just haven't had the energy to go chasing it down."<br><br>"Don't you think you should find the energy? All that equipment..."<br><br>"I'm very aware of what I lost in the fire. I don't need you to summarize. Anyway, I've been making use of Bud's old tractor. Plus, Jack had some extra tools."<br><br>"That's very nice. But don't you want your own things?"<br><br>"Yes, Liss," he said, his tone getting hard. "I would very much like to have my own shit. Actually, what I would really like is for my barn not to have burned down."</p><h2>The Last Unicorn The Lost Journey</h2><p><b>Special Commemorative Edition celebrating the 50th Anniversary of <i>The Last Unicorn</i></b><br><br>Peter S.

It exposes the questionable origins of <i>Reclaiming History</i> in a dubious mock trial for cable television, in which Bugliosi played the role of an attorney prosecuting Lee Harvey Oswald for murder, and how this formed the basis for the epic tome. Author James DiEugenio details the myriad problems with Bugliosi&#x2019;s book, and explores the cooperation of the mainstream press in concealing these many faults during the publicity campaign for the book and how this lack of scrutiny led Hanks and Goetzman to purchase the film rights. DiEugenio then shows how the film eventually adapted from that book, entitled <i>Parkland</i>, does not even resemble <i>Reclaiming History</i>, though the script for that film displays the same imbalance that <i>Reclaiming History</i> does.<br><br><i>Reclaiming Parkland</i> also includes extended looks at the little-known aspects of the lives and careers of Bugliosi, Hanks, and Goetzman including Bugliosi&#x2019;s three attempts at political office and a review of the Tate-LaBianca murders in the light of today&#x2019;s knowledge of that case. DiEugenio also looks at the connections between Washington and Hollywood, as well as the CIA influence in the film colony today. <i>Reclaiming Parkland</i> is a truly unique book that delves into the Kennedy assassination, the New Hollywood, and the political influence on how films are made today.<br><br>Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade imprint, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in history--books about World War II, the Third Reich, Hitler and his henchmen, the JFK assassination, conspiracies, the American Civil War, the American Revolution, gladiators, Vikings, ancient Rome, medieval times, the old West, and much more.

Kolatch addresses hundreds of fundamental questions frequently asked about Jewish life and practice. In this sequel volume, he delves more deeply into the subject matter touched upon in that best-selling work and goes on to explore more complex and controversial subjects, including abortion, homosexuality, birth control, artificial insemination, organ transplants, smoking, proselytizing, intermarriage, Jewish-Christian relations, and the changing role of women in Jewish life.<p> Recognizing the importance of our understanding how Jewish law developed and how legal authorities arrived at their decisions, Rabbi Kolatch opens The Second Jewish Book of Why with an overview of Jewish legal development from biblical times to the present. He introduces us to the major interpreters of Jewish law, explores the relationship between law and custom, and explains the basic principles upon which much of Jewish practice is based.</p><p> Following the same concise question-answer format he established in The Jewish Book of Why and the straightforward writing style for which he is renowned, Rabbi Kolatch addresses all questions without judgment or bias, presenting the beliefs and practices of all denominations. Featuring notes and a detailed index covering both of the Why volumes, The Second Jewish Book of Why is essential for anyone seeking an understanding of the Jewish heritage.</p></p><p>Alfred J.

As Shaughnessy conjures our potential future, she movingly (and often with humor) envisions an age where cephalopods might rule over humankind, a fate she suggests we may just deserve after destroying their oceans. These heartbreaking, terrified poems are the battle cry of a woman who is fighting for the survival of the world she loves, and a stirring exhibition of who we are as a civilization.</p><p>BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY was born in Okinawa and raised in Southern California.

For what?<br> &nbsp;<br> Every time is the last&#x2014;for that particular goodbye, wearing those clothes, at that airport. Me in my black dress&#x2014;nightgown, &#x2018;50s housecoat, funeral uniform. It passes for anything. <br> &nbsp;<br> My daughter in her fuchsia track shorts and faded green t-shirt almost as soft as her luscious little arms. She was complaining, as usual. She was hungry. She was tired of traveling.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her complaints were especially unpleasant since they only pointed up how innocent she was of how bad everything could get. The Legos are boring? Imagine no toys of any kind. <br> &nbsp;<br> The chicken nuggets are too hot? Just wait. They&#x2019;ll cool and by then, I hope she can learn to like lizard blood and shoelace chewing gum, because that&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s coming. <br> &nbsp;<br> A fierce zip of pride bites my heart. She demands more because she knows there&#x2019;s more in the world and she believes she should have it all. She knows what she wants: what she wants. <br> &nbsp;<br> She believes the world is coming to her, not veering definitively away. She still thinks we can choose between ice cream flavors, bless her that she has so many possible flavors in mind. <br> &nbsp;<br> Between stuffed animals and dolls. Which color lunch box you want for the whole school year. What school year, I think? Will first grade exist this coming fall? <br> &nbsp;<br> She still thinks that what she thinks will affect what she gets. She still believes tantrums might get her her way. She doesn&#x2019;t know yet that nobody gets her way. <br> &nbsp;<br> We&#x2019;re all lucky if we get anything at all, come dinnertime, come night, the next morning and the next hot morning, the next endangered livingspace if we get to stay there. We can&#x2019;t carry all that stuff. But she doesn&#x2019;t think of it as stuff. <br> &nbsp;<br> She thinks of it as what she wants. Life&#x2019;s been consistent&#x2014;me resisting her demands, me in my black dress, cutting my hair to make her paintbrushes. If something happens to me, who will help her believe her beliefs?<br> &nbsp;<br> She believes her desires&#x2014;as erratic and irrational as a six-year old&#x2019;s desire&#x2019;s can be&#x2014;nevertheless have intrinsic value.&nbsp; A thread of hope wound, inextricable, all around and through her very person. I believe that too.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> One of these mornings I&#x2019;ll say goodbye, a routine goodbye when I go to the FedPlex warehouse to work or pick my rations, and in my absence she will lose that thread, come to fully understand what she wants is impossible in our world. <br> &nbsp;<br> All of it, any of it, the tiniest thing, impossible. <br> &nbsp;<br> I won&#x2019;t have known but I&#x2019;ll be walking away from my daughter for the last time, coming home (wherever home is) to someone new, someone broken off from my old girl, six years old.<br> &nbsp;<br> Here, I tell her, providing a pencil with a pristine, unsharpened end, chew on this.

After the death of her parents, she is apprenticed to an eccentric wax sculptor and whisked off to the seamy streets of Paris, where they meet a domineering widow and her quiet, pale son. Together, they convert an abandoned monkey house into an exhibition hall for wax heads, and the spectacle becomes a sensation. As word of her artistic talent spreads, Marie is called to Versailles, where she tutors a princess and saves Marie Antoinette in childbirth. But outside the palace walls, Paris is roiling: The revolutionary mob is demanding heads, and . . . at the wax museum, heads are what they do.<br><br>In the tradition of Gregory Maguire's <i>Wicked</i> and Erin Morgenstern's <i>The Night Circus</i>, Edward Carey's <i>Little</i> is a darkly endearing cavalcade of a novel--a story of art, class, determination, and how we hold on to what we love.</p><p><b>Edward Carey<i> </i></b>is a novelist, visual artist, and playwright.

I was not much bigger, at first, than the size of my mother's little hands put together, and I was not expected to live very long. And yet, after I survived my first night, I went on, despite contrary predictions, to breathe through my first week. After that my heart still kept time, without interruption, throughout my first month. Pigheaded, pocket-sized thing.</p><p>My lonely mother was eighteen years old at my birth, a small woman, a little under five foot, marked by being the daughter of a priest. This priest, my grandfather, made a widower by smallpox, had been a very strict man, a fury in black cloth, who never let his daughter out of his sight. After he died, my mother's life changed. Mother began to meet people, villagers who called upon her, and among them was a soldier. This soldier, a bachelor somewhat beyond the customary age, possessing a somber temperament brought on by witnessing so many appalling things and losing so many soldier friends, took a fancy to Mother; he thought they could be happy, so to speak, being sad together. Her name was Anna-Maria Waltner. His name was Joseph Georg Grosholtz. They were married. My mother and my father. Here was loving and here was joy.</p><p>My mother had a large nose, in the Roman style. My father, I believe, had a strong chin that pointed a little upward. That chin and that nose, it seems, fitted together. After a little while, however, Father's furlough was over, and he returned to war. Mother's nose and Father's chin had known each other for three weeks.</p><p>To begin with, for always, there was love. The love my father and mother had for each other was forever present on my face. I was born with both the Waltner nose and the Grosholtz chin. Each attribute was a noteworthy thing on its own, and nicely gave character to the faces of those two families; combined, the result was a little ungainly, as if I were showing more flesh than was my personal due. Children will grow how they will. Some distinguish themselves as prodigies of hair growth, or cut teeth at a wonderfully young age; some are freckled all over; others arrive so pale that their white nakedness is a shock to all who witness it. I nosed and chinned my way into life. I was, certainly, unaware then of what extraordinary bodies I should come to know, of what vast buildings I would inhabit, of what bloody events I would find myself trapped within, and yet, it seems to me, my nose and my chin already had some inkling of it all. Nose and chin, such an armor for life. Nose and chin, such companions.</p><p>Since girls of my stamp were not schooled, it was Mother who gave me education through God. The Bible was my primer. Elsewise, I fetched in logs, looked for kindling in the woods, washed plates and clothes, cut vegetables, fetched meat. I swept. I cleaned. I carried. I was always busy. Mother taught me industry. If my mother was busy, she was happy; it was when she stopped that uncertainty caught up with her, only to be dispelled by some new activity. She was constantly in motion, and movement suited her well.</p><p>"Discover," she would say, "what you can do. You'll always find something. One day your father will return, and he'll see what a good and useful child you are."</p><p>"Thank you, Mother. I shall be most useful, I do wish it."</p><p>"What a creature you are!"</p><p>"Am I? A creature?"</p><p>"Yes, my own little creature."</p><p>Mother brushed my hair with extraordinary vigor. Sometimes she touched my cheek or patted my bonnet. She was probably not very beautiful, but I thought her so. She had a small mole just beneath one of her eyelids. I wish I could remember her smile. I do know she had one.</p><p>By the age of five I had grown to the height of the old dog in the house next to ours. Later I would be the height of doorknobs, which I liked to rub. Later still, and here I would stop, I would be the height of many people's hearts. Women observing me in the village were sometimes heard to mutter, as they kissed me, "Finding a husband will not be easy."</p><p>On my fifth birthday, my dear mother gave me a doll. This was Marta. I named her myself. I knew her little body, about a sixth the size of my own; I learned it entirely as I moved it about, sometimes roughly, sometimes with great tenderness. She came to me naked and without a face. She was a collection of seven wooden pegs, which could be assembled in a certain order to roughly resemble the human figure. Marta, save my mother, was my first intimate connection with the world; I was never without her. We were happy together: Mother, Marta, and me.</p></p><h2>Basic Bookbinding</h2><p><p>Starting from basic principles and assuming no previous experience, this modern exposition of the elements of bookbinding enables both the beginner and the expert to apply the latest and most simplified techniques to rebinding old favorites and binding many new paperback books.<br>A complete list of all necessary materials, including a guide to the proper selection of tools, paper, boards, cloth, leather, or sheepskin covering fabrics and lettering inks and pigments, introduces the subject.

The <i>Princess Cecile</i>, the corvette in which they carved their reputations in letters of fire, has been sold as a private yacht, but she still has her guns, her missiles, and her veteran crew. Daniel and Adele will need all of those things as they face winged dragons, an Alliance auxiliary cruiser, jealous lovers, and a mysterious oracle which really does foresee the future. That won't be enough, though, when they penetrate a secret Alliance base and find a hostile fleet ready for a war that will sweep Cinnabar out of a strategically crucial arm of the galaxy. Preventing that will involve skill, courage, and more luck than a sane man could even pray for; and it will require a space battle on a scale that a tiny corvette like the <i>Princess Cecile</i> has no business being involved in.

This period was dominated by the Anatoly Karpov (world champion from 1975 to 1985) and his three-time challenger, Viktor Korchnoi.<br><br>Anatoly Karpov gained the right to challenge Bobby Fischer for the world title by winning through the Candidates series in 1974. As is well known, Fischer refused to defend the title and in 1975 Karpov became champion "by default." Although he did not have to contest a Championship match to gain the title, Karpov proved that he was a worthy champion by winning virtually every major tournament over the next decade.<br><br>In this book, a must for all serious chess players Kasparov analyzes deeply Karpov's greatest games and assesses the legacy of this great Russian genius. Also under the microscope are the games of Viktor Korchnoi who was at his peak during this period and twice challenged Karpov for his world title.<br></p><p>The battle for the World Chess Championship has witnessed numerous titanic struggles which have engaged the interest not only of the chess enthusiasts but of the public at large.

But today that synthesis is under attack&#x2014;from the East by radical Islam (faith without reason) and from within the West itself by aggressive secularism (reason without faith). The stakes are incalculably high.<br> <br> The na�ve and increasingly common assumption that reason and faith are incompatible is simply at odds with the facts of history. The revelation in the Hebrew Scriptures of a reasonable Creator imbued Judaism and Christianity with a conviction that the world is intelligible, leading to the flowering of reason and the invention of science in the West. It was no accident that the Enlightenment took place in the culture formed by the Jewish and Christian faiths.<br> <br> We can all see that faith without reason is benighted at best, fanatical and violent at worst. But too many forget that reason, stripped of faith, is subject to its own pathologies. A supposedly autonomous reason easily sinks into fanaticism, stifling dissent as bigoted and irrational and devouring the humane civilization fostered by the integration of reason and faith. The blood-soaked history of the twentieth century attests to the totalitarian forces unleashed by corrupted reason.<br> <br> But Samuel Gregg does more than lament the intellectual and spiritual ruin caused by the divorce of reason and faith. He shows that each of these foundational principles corrects the other&#x2019;s excesses and enhances our comprehension of the truth in a continuous renewal of civilization. By recovering this balance, we can avoid a suicidal winner-take-all conflict between reason and faith and a future that will respect neither.</p><p>SAMUEL GREGG, the research director at the Acton Institute in Grand Rapids, Michigan, writes and speaks on questions of political economy, economic history, ethics in finance, and natural law theory. He holds D.Phil. in moral philosophy and political economy from the University of Oxford. His previous books include <i>For God and Profit: How Banking and Finance Can Serve the Common Good</i> and <i>Becoming Europe</i>.&#x201c;Samuel Gregg poses the only question that matters: Can the West survive? It can, he concludes, but only by resorting to the radical measure of becoming, once again, itself. This book is a trumpet blast, calling an entire civilization to arise as from a trance&#x2014;to <i>true</i> &#x2018;wokeness.&#x2019; A magnificent achievement.&#x201d; &#x2014;Peter Robinson, former speechwriter to President Reagan and Murdoch Distinguished Policy Fellow at the Hoover Institution<br><br>&#x201c;Understanding Western civilization&#x2019;s present crisis involves grasping how and why the separation of reason and faith has left the West adrift. In this powerful book, Samuel Gregg shows that restoring faith and reason&#x2014;<i>fides et ratio</i>&#x2014;to their proper place is essential if the West is to rediscover itself and draw upon the best of its religious heritage and the Enlightenment&#x2019;s achievements.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;James V. Schall, S.J. (1928-2019), professor emeritus, Georgetown University<br><br>&#x201c;Samuel Gregg has put us all in his debt by recalling us to the fundamental truth&#x2014;once obvious&#x2014;that reason without faith is sterile. <i>Reason, Faith, and the Struggle for Western Civilization </i>is a masterly inquiry into what has made what we call &#x2018;the West&#x2019; the dynamo that changed the world. The answer cannot be found in political innovation or technological prowess alone, but also involves a recognition of that horizon of transcendence that grounds reason and the whole Enlightenment project. This is a deep and authoritative inquiry into the resources that our civilization requires to succeed but which are everywhere under siege. Anyone who cares about the future of Western civilization should read this.&#x201d; &#x2014;Roger Kimball, editor and publisher, The New Criterion<br> &nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;If you think &#x2018;Enlightenment&#x2019; means only science, if you think Western civilization is only about politics and economics, or if you think faith and reason cannot coexist, then you need to read this book. What gave rise to the West, Samuel Gregg argues, was not just science, politics, or economics, but a vision of the human person that did not separate but integrated faith and reason. Gregg shows the way out of our spreading &#x2018;pathologies of reason and faith,&#x2019; demonstrating the true nature, and limitations, of reason, its deep connection to faith, and their complementary roles. The benefits of Western civilization can be realized in no other way. Gregg shows us how they might be preserved not only for us but for future generations.&#x201d; &#x2014;James R. Otteson, Thomas W. Smith Presidential Chair in Business Ethics, professor of economics at Wake Forest University<br><br>&#x201c;Faith and reason form the foundation of the optimistic outlook in Samuel Gregg&#x2019;s book. He shows how reason unmoored in faith and faith detached from reason easily drift into forms of unequal treatment, denying our creation in the image of God, which anchors us in hope. From Genesis to Paul, Gregg shows that the arrow is from Truth to Freedom, through <i>logos</i> to &#x2018;enlightenment.&#x2019; The West has flourished in this freedom. May it <i>never</i> be lost.&#x201d; &#x2014;Vernon L. Smith, 2002 Nobel laureate in Economics, Chapman University<br><br>&#x201c;Samuel Gregg has written a clear, eloquent, and concise guide to the intellectual and spiritual currents, rooted in reason and faith, which inform Western civilization at its best. He does full justice to the West&#x2019;s Jewish and Christian roots and their affirmation of reason&#x2019;s ability to articulate freedom&#x2019;s purposes. He also lauds the best currents of Enlightenment thought even as he warns against the &#x2018;forces of destruction&#x2019; that increasingly impel the modern world toward tyranny and a soul-destroying nihilism. With impressive learning and grace, he shows his readers &#x2018;a way back&#x2019; to the old verities that point the way toward a promising future. A must-read for all who care about the fate of a Western civilization rooted in truth and liberty.&#x201d; &#x2014;Daniel J.

It was the site of a massive human sacrifice, and for Carrasco the center of fiercely provocative questions: If ritual violence against humans was a profound necessity for the Aztecs in their capital city, is it central to the construction of social order and the authority of city states? Is civilization built on violence?<br><br>In <i>City of Sacrifice,</i>Carrasco chronicles the fascinating story of Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital, investigating Aztec religious practices and demonstrating that religious violence was integral to urbanization; the city itself was a temple to the gods. That Mexico City, the largest city on earth, was built on the ruins of Tenochtitlan, is a point Carrasco poignantly considers in his comparison of urban life from antiquity to modernity.<br><br>Majestic in scope, <i>City of Sacrifice</i> illuminates not only the rich history of a major Meso american city but also the inseparability of two passionate human impulses: urbanization and religious engagement. It has much to tell us about many familiar events in our own time, from suicide bombings in Tel Aviv to rape and murder in the Balkans.</p><p>Dav�d L. Carrasco is professor of history of religions at Princeton University. Author and editor of many books, he is editor in chief of the <i>Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures.</i> He lives in Princeton, New Jersey.A brilliant, provocative, timely, and eternal book.... We know that power, whatever its origin-sacred, natural, ethnic, contractual, or democratic-is an expression of violence. Dav�d Carrasco now demonstrates a shattering, unsentimental truth: civilizations themselves are born and maintained by violence. &#x2014;Carlos Fuentes</p><h2>City of Bones: TV Tie-in (1) (The Mortal Instruments)</h2><p>Don&#x2019;t miss <i>Shadowhunters:</i> <i>The Mortal Instruments</i>, soon to be an Freeform original series.

He stared down at the boy in the red zip-up jacket and shook his shaved head. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t bring that thing in here.&#x201d;<br> <br>The fifty or so teenagers in line outside the Pandemonium Club leaned forward to eavesdrop. It was a long wait to get into the all-ages club, especially on a Sunday, and not much generally happened in line. The bouncers were fierce and would come down instantly on anyone who looked like they were going to start trouble. Fifteen-year-old Clary Fray, standing in line with her best friend, Simon, leaned forward along with everyone else, hoping for some excitement.<br> <br>&#x201c;Aw, come on.&#x201d; The kid hoisted the thing up over his head. It looked like a wooden beam, pointed at one end. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s part of my costume.&#x201d;<br> <br>The bouncer raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;Which is what?&#x201d;<br> <br>The boy grinned. He was normal-enough-looking, Clary thought, for Pandemonium. He had electric blue dyed hair that stuck up around his head like the tentacles of a startled octopus, but no elaborate facial tattoos or big metal bars through his ears or lips. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a vampire hunter.&#x201d; He pushed down on the wooden thing. It bent as easily as a blade of grass bending sideways. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s fake. Foam rubber. See?&#x201d;<br> <br>The boy&#x2019;s wide eyes were way too bright a green, Clary noticed: the color of antifreeze, spring grass. Colored contact lenses, probably. The bouncer shrugged, abruptly bored. &#x201c;Whatever. Go on in.&#x201d;<br> <br>The boy slid past him, quick as an eel. Clary liked the lilt to his shoulders, the way he tossed his hair as he went. There was a word for him that her mother would have used&#x2014;insouciant.<br> <br>&#x201c;You thought he was cute,&#x201d; said Simon, sounding resigned. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Clary dug her elbow into his ribs, but didn&#x2019;t answer.<br> <br><br> <br>Inside, the club was full of dry-ice smoke. Colored lights played over the dance floor, turning it into a multicolored fairyland of blues and acid greens, hot pinks and golds.<br> <br>The boy in the red jacket stroked the long razor-sharp blade in his hands, an idle smile playing over his lips. It had been so easy&#x2014;a little bit of a glamour on the blade, to make it look harmless. Another glamour on his eyes, and the moment the bouncer had looked straight at him, he was in. Of course, he could probably have gotten by without all that trouble, but it was part of the fun&#x2014;fooling the mundies, doing it all out in the open right in front of them, getting off on the blank looks on their sheeplike faces.<br> <br>Not that the humans didn&#x2019;t have their uses. The boy&#x2019;s green eyes scanned the dance floor, where slender limbs clad in scraps of silk and black leather appeared and disappeared inside the revolving columns of smoke as the mundies danced. Girls tossed their long hair, boys swung their leather-clad hips, and bare skin glittered with sweat. Vitality just poured off them, waves of energy that filled him with a drunken dizziness. His lip curled. They didn&#x2019;t know how lucky they were. They didn&#x2019;t know what it was like to eke out life in a dead world, where the sun hung limp in the sky like a burned cinder. Their lives burned as brightly as candle flames&#x2014;and were as easy to snuff out.<br> <br>His hand tightened on the blade he carried, and he had begun to step out onto the dance floor when a girl broke away from the mass of dancers and began walking toward him. He stared at her. She was beautiful, for a human&#x2014;long hair nearly the precise color of black ink, charcoaled eyes. Floor-length white gown, the kind women used to wear when this world was younger. Lace sleeves belled out around her slim arms. Around her neck was a thick silver chain, on which hung a dark red pendant the size of a baby&#x2019;s fist. He only had to narrow his eyes to know that it was real&#x2014;real and precious. His mouth started to water as she neared him. Vital energy pulsed from her like blood from an open wound. She smiled, passing him, beckoning with her eyes. He turned to follow her, tasting the phantom sizzle of her death on his lips.<br> <br>It was always easy. He could already feel the power of her evaporating life coursing through his veins like fire. Humans were so stupid. They had something so precious, and they barely safeguarded it at all. They threw away their lives for money, for packets of powder, for a stranger&#x2019;s charming smile. The girl was a pale ghost retreating through the colored smoke. She reached the wall and turned, bunching her skirt up in her hands, lifting it as she grinned at him. Under the skirt, she was wearing thigh-high boots.<br> <br>He sauntered up to her, his skin prickling with her nearness. Up close she wasn&#x2019;t so perfect: He could see the mascara smudged under her eyes, the sweat sticking her hair to her neck. He could smell her mortality, the sweet rot of corruption. Got you, he thought.<br> <br>A cool smile curled her lips. She moved to the side, and he could see that she was leaning against a closed door. NO ADMITTANCE&#x2014;STORAGE was scrawled across it in red paint. She reached behind her for the knob, turned it, slid inside. He caught a glimpse of stacked boxes, tangled wiring. A storage room. He glanced behind him&#x2014;no one was looking. So much the better if she wanted privacy.<br> <br>He slipped into the room after her, unaware that he was being followed.<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; Simon said, &#x201c;pretty good music, eh?&#x201d;<br> <br>Clary didn&#x2019;t reply. They were dancing, or what passed for it&#x2014;a lot of swaying back and forth with occasional lunges toward the floor as if one of them had dropped a contact lens&#x2014;in a space between a group of teenage boys in metallic corsets, and a young Asian couple who were making out passionately, their colored hair extensions tangled together like vines. A boy with a lip piercing and a teddy bear backpack was handing out free tablets of herbal ecstasy, his parachute pants flapping in the breeze from the wind machine. Clary wasn&#x2019;t paying much attention to their immediate surroundings&#x2014;her eyes were on the blue-haired boy who&#x2019;d talked his way into the club. He was prowling through the crowd as if he were looking for something. There was something about the way he moved that reminded her of something . . . <br> <br>&#x201c;I, for one,&#x201d; Simon went on, &#x201c;am enjoying myself immensely.&#x201d;<br> <br>This seemed unlikely. Simon, as always, stuck out at the club like a sore thumb, in jeans and an old T-shirt that said MADE IN BROOKLYN across the front. His freshly scrubbed hair was dark brown instead of green or pink, and his glasses perched crookedly on the end of his nose. He looked less as if he were contemplating the powers of darkness and more as if he were on his way to chess club.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mmm-hmm.&#x201d; Clary knew perfectly well that he came to Pandemonium with her only because she liked it, that he thought it was boring. She wasn&#x2019;t even sure why it was that she liked it&#x2014;the clothes, the music made it like a dream, someone else&#x2019;s life, not her boring real life at all. But she was always too shy to talk to anyone but Simon.<br> <br>The blue-haired boy was making his way off the dance floor. He looked a little lost, as if he hadn&#x2019;t found whom he was looking for. Clary wondered what would happen if she went up and introduced herself, offered to show him around. Maybe he&#x2019;d just stare at her. Or maybe he was shy too. Maybe he&#x2019;d be grateful and pleased, and try not to show it, the way boys did&#x2014;but she&#x2019;d know. Maybe&#x2014;<br> <br>The blue-haired boy straightened up suddenly, snapping to attention, like a hunting dog on point. Clary followed the line of his gaze, and saw the girl in the white dress.<br> <br>Oh, well, Clary thought, trying not to feel like a deflated party balloon. I guess that&#x2019;s that. The girl was gorgeous, the kind of girl Clary would have liked to draw&#x2014;tall and ribbon-slim, with a long spill of black hair. Even at this distance Clary could see the red pendant around her throat. It pulsed under the lights of the dance floor like a separate, disembodied heart.<br> <br>&#x201c;I feel,&#x201d; Simon went on, &#x201c;that this evening DJ Bat is doing a singularly exceptional job. Don&#x2019;t you agree?&#x201d;<br> <br>Clary rolled her eyes and didn&#x2019;t answer; Simon hated trance music. Her attention was on the girl in the white dress. Through the darkness, smoke, and artificial fog, her pale dress shone out like a beacon. No wonder the blue-haired boy was following her as if he were under a spell, too distracted to notice anything else around him&#x2014;even the two dark shapes hard on his heels, weaving after him through the crowd.<br> <br>Clary slowed her dancing and stared. She could just make out that the shapes were boys, tall and wearing black clothes. She couldn&#x2019;t have said how she knew that they were following the other boy, but she did. She could see it in the way they paced him, their careful watchfulness, the slinking grace of their movements. A small flower of apprehension began to open inside her chest.<br> <br>&#x201c;Meanwhile,&#x201d; Simon added, &#x201c;I wanted to tell you that lately I&#x2019;ve been cross-dressing. Also, I&#x2019;m sleeping with your mom. I thought you should know.&#x201d;<br> <br>The girl had reached the wall, and was opening a door marked NO ADMITTANCE. She beckoned the blue-haired boy after her, and they slipped through the door. It wasn&#x2019;t anything Clary hadn&#x2019;t seen before, a couple sneaking off to the dark corners of the club to make out&#x2014;but that made it even weirder that they were being followed.<br> <br>She raised herself up on tiptoe, trying to see over the crowd. The two guys had stopped at the door and seemed to be conferring with each other. One of them was blond, the other dark-haired. The blond one reached into his jacket and drew out something long and sharp that flashed under the strobing lights. A knife. &#x201c;Simon!&#x201d; Clary shouted, and seized his arm.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Simon looked alarmed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not really sleeping with your mom, you know. I was just trying to get your attention. Not that your mom isn&#x2019;t a very attractive woman, for her age.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you see those guys?&#x201d; She pointed wildly, almost hitting a curvy black girl who was dancing nearby. The girl shot her an evil look. &#x201c;Sorry&#x2014;sorry!&#x201d; Clary turned back to Simon. &#x201c;Do you see those two guys over there? By that door?&#x201d;<br> <br>Simon squinted, then shrugged. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see anything.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There are two of them. They were following the guy with the blue hair&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The one you thought was cute?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, but that&#x2019;s not the point. The blond one pulled a knife.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d; Simon stared harder, shaking his head. &#x201c;I still don&#x2019;t see anyone.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure.&#x201d;<br> <br>Suddenly all business, Simon squared his shoulders. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get one of the security guards. You stay here.&#x201d; He strode away, pushing through the crowd.<br> <br>Clary turned just in time to see the blond boy slip through the NO ADMITTANCE door, his friend right on his heels. She looked around; Simon was still trying to shove his way across the dance floor, but he wasn&#x2019;t making much progress. Even if she yelled now, no one would hear her, and by the time Simon got back, something terrible might already have happened. Biting hard on her lower lip, Clary started to wriggle through the crowd.<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;<br> <br>She turned and smiled. What faint light there was in the storage room spilled down through high barred windows smeared with dirt. Piles of electrical cables, along with broken bits of mirrored disco balls and discarded paint cans littered the floor.<br> <br>&#x201c;Isabelle.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a nice name.&#x201d; He walked toward her, stepping carefully among the wires in case any of them were live. In the faint light she looked half-transparent, bleached of color, wrapped in white like an angel. It would be a pleasure to make her fall. . . . &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t seen you here before.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re asking me if I come here often?&#x201d; She giggled, covering her mouth with her hand. There was some sort of bracelet around her wrist, just under the cuff of her dress&#x2014;then, as he neared her, he saw that it wasn&#x2019;t a bracelet at all but a pattern inked into her skin, a matrix of swirling lines.<br> <br>He froze. &#x201c;You&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>He didn&#x2019;t finish. She moved with lightning swiftness, striking out at him with her open hand, a blow to his chest that would have sent him down gasping if he&#x2019;d been a human being. He staggered back, and now there was something in her hand, a coiling whip that glinted gold as she brought it down, curling around his ankles, jerking him off his feet. He hit the ground, writhing, the hated metal biting deep into his skin. She laughed, standing over him, and dizzily he thought that he should have known. No human girl would wear a dress like the one Isabelle wore. She&#x2019;d worn it to cover her skin&#x2014;all of her skin.<br> <br>Isabelle yanked hard on the whip, securing it. Her smile glittered like poisonous water. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s all yours, boys.&#x201d;<br> <br>A low laugh sounded behind him, and now there were hands on him, hauling him upright, throwing him against one of the concrete pillars. He could feel the damp stone under his back. His hands were pulled behind him, his wrists bound with wire. As he struggled, someone walked around the side of the pillar into his view: a boy, as young as Isabelle and just as pretty. His tawny eyes glittered like chips of amber. &#x201c;So,&#x201d; the boy said. &#x201c;Are there any more with you?&#x201d;<br> <br>The blue-haired boy could feel blood welling up under the too-tight metal, making his wrists slippery. &#x201c;Any other what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on now.&#x201d; The tawny-eyed boy held up his hands, and his dark sleeves slipped down, showing the runes inked all over his wrists, the backs of his hands, his palms. &#x201c;You know what I am.&#x201d;<br> <br>Far back inside his skull, the shackled boy&#x2019;s second set of teeth began to grind.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shadowhunter,&#x201d; he hissed.<br> <br>The other boy grinned all over his face. &#x201c;Got you,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br><br> <br>Clary pushed the door to the storage room open, and stepped inside. For a moment she thought it was deserted. The only windows were high up and barred; faint street noise came through them, the sound of honking cars and squealing brakes. The room smelled like old paint, and a heavy layer of dust covered the floor, marked by smeared shoe prints.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s no one in here, she realized, looking around in bewilderment. It was cold in the room, despite the August heat outside. Her back was icy with sweat. She took a step forward, tangling her feet in electrical wires. She bent down to free her sneaker from the cables&#x2014;and heard voices. A girl&#x2019;s laugh, a boy answering sharply. When she straightened up, she saw them.<br> <br>It was as if they had sprung into existence between one blink of her eyes and the next. There was the girl in her long white dress, her black hair hanging down her back like damp seaweed. The two boys were with her&#x2014;the tall one with black hair like hers, and the smaller, fair one, whose hair gleamed like brass in the dim light coming through the windows high above. The fair boy was standing with his hands in his pockets, facing the punk kid, who was tied to a pillar with what looked like piano wire, his hands stretched behind him, his legs bound at the ankles. His face was pulled tight with pain and fear.<br> <br>Heart hammering in her chest, Clary ducked behind the nearest concrete pillar and peered around it. She watched as the fair-haired boy paced back and forth, his arms now crossed over his chest. &#x201c;So,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You still haven&#x2019;t told me if there are any other of your kind with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Your kind? Clary wondered what he was talkin...</p><h2>The Mandolin Picker&#39;s Fakebook</h2><p>(Music Sales America).

Why are the contents of the letters so controversial? Why has a suspect in the theft turned up dead? And what should magistrate Sir John Fielding do about his feeling that Benjamin Franklin is somehow complicit? While the tensions rise, Sir John and his prot�g�, Jeremy Proctor, search for answers&#x2014;and find that justice isn&#x2019;t always served by the letter of the law.</p><p><b>Bruce Alexander</b> is the pseudonym for a well-known author of fiction and nonfiction. The books in his series include&nbsp;<i>Blind Justice; Murder in Grub Street</i><b>&nbsp;</b>(named by&nbsp;the <i>New York Times Book Review</i>&nbsp;as a notable book in 1995);&nbsp;<i>Watery Grave; Person or Persons Unknown</i>&nbsp;(named by the&nbsp;<i>Chicago Tribune</i>&nbsp;as one of the best novels of 1997);&nbsp;<i>Jack, Knave and Fool</i>; and&nbsp;<i>Death of a Colonial</i>.Sir John Fielding and his young prot&#x201a;g&#x201a;, Jeremy Proctor, those delightful Georgian versions of Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin, get mixed up in pre-Revolutionary War intrigue in their ninth outing (after 2001's Smuggler's Moon). A burglary of the home of the British secretary of state for colonial affairs turns violent, leading to the disappearance of some valuable letters that may be connected with the incipient rebellion in Massachusetts. While Sir John, the legendary Blind Beak of Bow Street, sits and thinks, Jeremy functions as his eyes and legs, interviewing witnesses, conducting surveillance and further developing his detective skills. Jeremy's burgeoning relationship with a servant girl adds depth to the drama. The sleuths enlist the aid of the legendary Samuel Johnson when the government, which is weighing the political merits of charging American patriots with treason, wants American envoy Benjamin Franklin interrogated as a suspect. Alexander evokes the period without anachronisms of word or thought to jar the reader. Franklin himself comes across as a fully realized character, with his strengths and frailties both on display. Given the relative unimportance of the puzzle element of the plot, this work ranks a little below Blind Justice and the superb Watery Grave. Still, Alexander's creations are as full of life and interest as when they debuted, a formidable accomplishment for a long series, one that mystery fans should hope has many more entries to come.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>My Marathon: Reflections on a Gold Medal Life</h2><p><i>My Marathon: Reflections on a Gold Medal Life</i> is a revealing memoir by Frank Shorter, the father of American distance running. After winning the 1969 NCAA title in the 10,000 meters during his senior year at Yale, Shorter went on to win a staggering 24 national titles on track, road, and cross-country courses, but it was in the marathon that Shorter achieved his greatest fame and recognition.<br><br>At the 1972 Munich Games, Shorter won the Olympic marathon finishing more than 2 minutes ahead of the second-place finisher. Four years later, he finished a controversial second in the marathon at the Olympic Games in Montreal. The controversy, still unresolved to this day, revolved around the East German &#x201c;winner&#x201d; being a possible drug cheat. Shorter later founded the United States Anti-Doping Agency. Written with noted sportswriter John Brant, <i>My Marathon</i> details these inspiring events, as well as the physical and emotional abuse Shorter suffered as a child. <br><br>This inspiring memoir is a testament to the resiliency of the human spirit and the transformative power of sports.</p><p><b>FRANK SHORTER</b> is the winner of 24 national championships and the 1972 Olympic marathon.

He was only 61 and had a masters in math and computer science, a very bright man. Of the 10 surviving children in our profoundly dysfunctional family, I looked most like my father--the same nose, the same thick mop of hair--and Chris, and possibly Nanette, my sister, resembled him most in terms of personality. Not the cruelty, of course, or the psychotic duplicity, but they shared a similar strain of stubbornness and combativeness. Chris fought back harder than the rest of us against our father's attacks and thus absorbed more punishment.<br><br>The beatings would go on for a long time with Chris. For the rest of us, not so long in real time, although in terms of psychic damage, the violence never ended. The beatings were relatively brief because my father would get tired. Pounding on a child was hard physical work. It would turn anaerobic in a hurry. He would curse and snort and sweat. We would be watching from the doorway of the victim's bedroom. For me, watching was worse than getting hit myself. Our father knew he had an audience. There was a strong element of theater to his sadistic performances.<br><br>They began downstairs in the kitchen late at night, after my father came home from rounds at the hospital, or after he had sat up with a woman in labor or cleaned and dressed the knife wound of a railroad worker injured in a barroom fight. After he had finished playing his role of savior of our town, he would come home, and the mask would drop away. Or maybe he just exchanged one mask for another. Maybe he never stopped playacting, even inside his own house. Even, perhaps, inside his own head.<br><br>Upstairs in our bedrooms, we would hear him interrogating our mother. By the timbre and volume of his voice, we could tell whether he'd been drinking--advantages and disadvantages, either way. He would grill her, asking about the day around the house with the kids. He wasn't trying to catch up on the news or reconnect with his family. He was fishing for a transgression, intent on uncovering a slight misstep that he'd conflate into a pretext for storming up the stairs, belt in hand, calling out the name of the night's victim. To justify his violence, my father needed to gin up a motive.<br><br>He didn't attack Chris more often than the rest of us, but my little brother's beatings stand out in my memory. Chris would thrash and flail. He would hold out a long time before he started to cry.<br><br>And now Chris was dying, from the complications of colon cancer. He had battled hard for several years, the familiar grinding cancer campaign. You pretend it will never happen to you, but it happens (it happened to me a few years ago, a pimple on the corner of my mouth blooming into a squamous skin cancer that required major reconstructive surgery). Chris's kidneys were shutting down, which messed up his blood-clotting mechanism, which meant that he was suffering internal hemorrhaging; bleeding to death inside his body. Now he was in the ICU at a hospital in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and there wasn't much time. A few of his siblings had gathered--Ruth and Barbara and Mary and myself.<br><br>As we stood vigil, my sisters and I got to talking. We had rarely talked when we were kids, for the same reason that resistance fighters in Nazi- occupied countries avoided speaking to one another. Under torture, we didn't want to divulge information that would expose our comrades. That frightened silence basically continued into adulthood. We had no good times to remember, so we tried not to remember at all. But now we were aging; now our brother was dying. Buried crimes came to light. Splinters flew from our lifelong family train wreck.<br><br>My sister revealed that Sam Jr., our severely disturbed oldest brother, had sexually molested Chris when he was little, a behavior Sam had learned from our father, who had sexually molested my sisters when they were young. I remembered the time Sam Jr. threw a hatchet at me; the blade quivered in the wall above my bed. We remembered Chris getting hammered because he was stubborn, because he wouldn't back down to our father. No, my sisters and I agreed, there wasn't much good for the Shorter family to remember.<br><br>My father, Samuel Shorter, MD, known to his devoted patients as Dr. Sam, lived an evil secret life in which he controlled his family through terror and out-of-control violence. It was so bad that I repressed most of his abuse and haven't been able to lash it together into a coherent narrative. Instead, shards of my childhood surface spontaneously, like icebergs bobbing in a calm sea. Dr. Sam: The only time he spent around us was to afflict us. The exceptions were so rare that they almost shine. I recall him playing with us in a swimming pool on one of our summer family trips. I remember him smiling on a chairlift in the Catskills or the Rockies--my father loved to ski.<br><br>My dominant image, however, even more indelible than the beatings, was his psychological abuse. The man was a master sadist, a dark genius. He could have taught the Gestapo or Stasi a trick or two. His verbal stilettos hurt worse than an actual truncheon.<br><br>I see him behind the wheel of our Buick station wagon, embarked on one of the house calls that formed a staple of his family practice back in the 1950s. Sometimes he would take me along, ostensibly to educate me, but, in fact, it was to terrorize me. I can hear him talking in a low monotone, telling lewd, horrible, racist, and misogynistic jokes, reciting the supposed sins and treacheries of my siblings, setting one child against the other.<br><br>Behind the closed windows of the station wagon, as he smiled and waved to the townspeople, he would keep spewing until we arrived at the house of his patient. Then, leaving me in the car to process his rant, he would transform into the prototype of a kindly family doc and go about saving the world. Very early on, I realized he was more of an actor than a physician.<br><br>A handsome, charming, diabolical actor. He was chunky and carried a bit of a gut, standing about 5'9" and weighing around 180 �ds. Even if I hadn't run marathons, I never would have let myself pack on the �ds, because I have lived my life by not emulating Dr. Samuel Shorter.<br><br>Another detail comes to mind: his tattoos. In the 1950s, it was odd for a professional man to sport tattoos, but Dr. Sam took pride in this common touch. One tat was straightforward: "Kitty," my mother's nickname, was engraved on his left forearm. On his right shoulder, ironically, he wore an image of the caduceus, underscored by the Hippocratic Oath: "First, Do No Harm." The tattoo on his right forearm was more difficult to interpret: an image of the cartoon character Felix the Cat. Did Dr. Sam identify with this character and his prowling tomcat proclivities? Did he regard himself as a hunter of the night? I don't know. I never cared enough to ask and hadn't remembered the tattoos until I saw Chris dying and started talking with my sisters. I specifically recalled Felix because I would see the cat's jaunty smile each time my father raised his hand to whip me.<br><br>The theater for our family's Gothic drama was Middletown, New York, 60 miles north of New York City, halfway between the Hudson and Delaware rivers in Orange County. This area was originally Iroquois Indian territory. As a boy I would often find arrowheads, or what I believed to be arrowheads, in a field by a creek where I caught tadpoles. In the 17th century, Dutch settlers sailed up the Hudson from their recently purchased Manhattan Island. The Dutch brutally eradicated the native people but failed to exorcise the valley's ghosts. This was Washington Irving country, the province of Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman. More than 300 years later, the old stone farmhouses dotting the countryside were still occupied by the descendants of those stern Calvinists; my boyhood friends had surnames like Van Orden and Van Fleet. The foursquare Dutch Colonial houses of our town were rumored to hold dark family secrets.<br><br>Fifteen miles from the Hudson River, at the midpoint of the Delaware and Hudson Canal, Middletown steadily prospered, becoming a nexus for the railroads running up to Lake Erie and its ports. Together, the New York, Ontario and Western (commonly known as the O&amp;W) Railway and the Erie Railroad formed our town's economic engine. Good transportation promoted industry, and from the mid-19th century up until the time I grew up there in the 1950s and early '60s, Middletown hummed with furniture, shoe, and lawn mower factories. The town nestled comfortably and attractively in the heart of the Hudson River valley, anchored by the tall white steeples of the Presbyterian, Episcopal, and Catholic churches.<br><br>Our family belonged to the Middletown elite. Dr. Sam's father, my grandfather, was a prominent optometrist who was famous for his practice's catchy motto: "See Longer, See Shorter." My father graduated from Hobart College and married my mother, Katherine, his hometown sweetheart, who lived five doors down from the Shorters and who had attended William Smith College, Hobart's sister school. He graduated in 1942, in the midst of the Second World War, and the army sent him through an accelerated wartime program at Temple University School of Medicine in Philadelphia. He received his MD degree in 1945 and shipped out to Germany just as the war was ending. He was stationed at Wiesbaden, West Germany, near Munich, where I was born in 1947.<br><br>Later, my sisters, three of whom are nurses, would speculate that our father's psychopathology might have sprung from the searing cases and scenes he encountered as a young physician in Germany just after World War II and at the dawn of the cold war. Bavaria was a grim place then, with mountains of rubble in Munich, the region's bombed-out capital; massive displaced persons camps; and the Soviet army poised just a few miles to the east. But I don't think my father had it so bad. His practice at the big US Army hospital in Wiesbaden was mostly routine: setting broken bones, administering penicillin shots, and the like. In fact, he maneuvered to have my delivery in the hospital in Munich, where the army brass received their medical treatment.<br><br>No, I don't see Germany as the seat of my father's ferocity. A more likely primary source was my grandfather, the "See Longer, See Shorter" optometrist, whom I remember as a hard, dour man who never showed any affection for his grandchildren. My father liked to tell a story from his own childhood. The family was driving on a trip to visit relatives in Missouri, his father at the wheel, the kids in the back seat. One of the children let his teddy bear fly out the window, which enraged the old man. Instead of stopping the car and retrieving the teddy bear, he reached back and, without taking his eyes off the road, raked the back of his hand across the faces of all three kids in the back seat.<br><br>As he told this story, Dr. Sam appeared anything but traumatized. In fact, he seemed delighted. My father was obviously impressed by his own father's fluency and resourcefulness with regard to violence. The sadistic streak clearly ran in the family.<br><br>In 1947, when I was an infant, Dr. Sam completed his military stint and returned to America. Instead of rushing back home to join the post-war prosperity flood of returning veterans, he chose an alternative path. Just as there was no clear accounting for his rage, there was no obvious source for my father's altruism, his taking the Hippocratic Oath to an extreme, his overwhelming desire to act as a savior in the world's eyes. He wasn't religiously observant, nor did he express strong political convictions. Whatever its source, even if he only sought to compensate publicly for his private atrocities, his drive to serve was daunting.<br><br>His first position in the States was serving coal miners and their families in the heart of Appalachia, in a place called Ward Hollow, West Virginia. We lived in a company house at the base of a desiccated mountain. Train tracks ran through our backyard, carrying miners to the mine face. I remember my father showing me a .38 caliber handgun that he said he carried for protection from snakes. What I recall most clearly, however, was receiving my first beating from my father. Again, a shard, a fragment of a memory: I am running, sobbing, across a hot asphalt road. I'm 3 years old. My father has taken his belt to me because I've soiled my diaper.<br><br>After a year or two in West Virginia, Dr. Sam decided to return to Middletown to establish his practice and raise his family. The town was at its postwar peak, with factories churning at full employment and housing tracts sprouting. Babies arrived by the bushel, and Dr. Sam delivered a high percentage of them. He bought a grand, rambling Victorian home on Highland Avenue and ran his practice out of offices on the ground floor.<br><br>By all appearances, he was a brilliant and tireless young doc. He worked heroically during the 1952 polio epidemic, administering the Salk vaccine, the first wonder drug of the Baby Boom era. He set fractured bones and treated the measles. Even today his influence is remembered in Middletown. If you go to the public library downtown, Phyllis Nestor, one of the reference librarians, will recall that Dr. Sam treated her poison ivy. My friend Ed Diana, the county commissioner, remembers him as a pillar of the community. Ed proclaimed a day in my father's honor when he retired from the county health department in 1996.<br><br>But at home my father was a psychopath who inflicted extreme physical, emotional, and sexual violence on his wife and children. Just as he worked tirelessly at his profession, he worked tirelessly at hurting us. It was as if he'd taken graduate courses in how to break our spirit and mess with our minds. He berated one of my sisters for her crossed eyes, a condition he refused to have treated until she was 7. He never attended one of his children's games, races, performances, or recitals. He kept my mother as a virtual prisoner in her own house.</p><h2>Hikaru no Go, Vol. 21 (21)</h2><p>An ancient ghost possesses Hikaru and unleashes his hidden genius!<br><br>Reads R to L (Japanese Style), for A audiences. <b>Great Expectations</b>The Hokuto Cup, a new tournament for young players from Japan, China and Korea, is looming, and Hikaru's rival Akira has already secured one of the coveted three places on Japan's team.

Christine&#x2019;s revelation throws shadows of betrayal, lust, and insanity onto the family&#x2019;s distinguished facade.<br><br>But after the lecture, Christine seems distant, uneasy, and sad. The next day, she disappears. Juno immediately suspects a connection to her friend&#x2019;s shocking speech. Although painfully reminded of her own experience with Neil&#x2019;s mental illness, Juno nevertheless peels away the layers of secrets and madness that surround the Penrose dynasty. She fears that Christine discovered something damning about them, perhaps even something worth killing for. And Juno is determined to find it&#x2014;for herself, for her friend, and for her long-lost husband.</p><p><b>Carol Goodman</b> is the author of <i>The Seduction of Water </i>and <i>The Lake of Dead Languages</i>.

I wouldn't have gone if she hadn't especially asked me to come. The force of her preference was as irresistible now as it had been nearly twenty years ago when of all the girls at Penrose College she chose me to be her best friend. So even though I'd made a vow to avoid the campus during reunion--and had managed to do so, so far--I find myself on Sunday afternoon rushing through the lengthening shadows toward the library, just as I had on so many Sunday evenings during college, making a last dash to catch up on everything I'd avoided doing all weekend.<br><br>Usually it was Christine herself who had lured me away from my work in the first place, who had unearthed me from whatever hole I'd buried myself in. "The Middle Ages can wait," she'd say, "but the Sargent exhibit at the Whitney is ending this weekend." She was always reading about some art exhibit that was just about to close. Carried along by her enthusiasm, I'd follow her to the train station, trying to keep up with her fast stride, in the wake of her long blond hair that streamed out behind her like the wings of a dove quivering on a current of air.<br><br>As I open the heavy library door I almost catch a glimpse of that hair, shining in a swath of sun behind me, but of course it's an illusion. Christine is inside, standing at the podium, miraculously transformed into this older, more constrained woman--a lecturer--her long golden hair tamed into a sleek coil.<br><br>"This is where you'd find me," Christine is saying to the audience as I slide into a folding chair in the back of the crowded hall--even the second-story galleries are packed with students sitting on the floor between the stacks--"after dinner Sunday nights, when the work I'd happily neglected all weekend finally caught up with me."<br><br>Rueful sighs stir the group seated beneath the stained-glass window. Clearly, I'm not the only one who'd been reminded, walking toward the library through the late afternoon sunshine, of those last minute penitential pilgrimages. And this is where I would find her, already at work on some paper due the next day, somehow arrived before me even though when we'd finally gotten back to the dorm from the city she'd claimed she was going to her room to sleep. While the escapades she'd led me on left me tired and bleary-eyed, they somehow left Christine refreshed and inspired. She had managed to write through the night and the paper she'd turn in on Monday morning would be the one the professors would hold up as the most original, the most brilliant.<br><br>"When I approached the table here below the window I always imagined that the Lady looked down at me askance," Christine continues, "'Oh, so you've finally seen fit to join us,' I imagined her saying. I believe I endowed her with the voice of Miss Colclough, my sophomore Chaucer professor." Christine pauses for another ripple of knowing laughter. Miss Coldclaw--as we called her--was legendary for her withering comments and draconian teaching methods. "In fact, over the years, as I studied below her I endowed the Lady in the Window with many roles--muse, companion, judge. But of course these were my own projections. What we've come to consider today is who she really is, what she has to tell us--the class of 1987--about ourselves, and why it's so important that we save her from decay."<br><br>Christine turns slightly and tilts her head up, meeting the gaze of the figure in the glass as if she had been passing on the street and recognized a friend at a second-story window. Throughout the lecture she turns like this to address the Lady as if they were contemporaries--and truly, even though Christine is dressed in a spare, sleeveless black shift (Prada, I think) and the Lady is robed in a medieval gown of embroidered damask (ruby glass acid-etched with a millefleur pattern and layered with white drapery glass), there is a kinship between the two women. There's something in the curve of their spines--Christine's when she leans back to look up at the window, the Lady as she arches her back away from her loom to look up from her labors--that echoes each other. They've got the same yellow hair. The Lady's by virtue of a medieval metallurgical process called silver stain, Christine's thanks to a colorist on the Upper East Side. The Lady's abundant Pre-Raphaelite locks, though, are loose, while Christine's long blond hair is twisted in a knot so heavy that when she bows her head back down to her notes her slender neck seems to pull against the strain. I realize, from that strain and from how thin she's gotten, what a toll this lecture has taken on her and instantly forgive her for not making time to see me these last six or seven months--the longest we've gone without seeing each other since college.<br><br>"No doubt we all heard the same story on the campus tour. The window was designed by Augustus Penrose, founder of the Rose Glass Works and Penrose College, in 1922 for the twentieth anniversary of the college's founding and it depicts Augustus's beloved wife, Eugenie. As we all know, Penrose College grew out of The Woman's Craft League which Eugenie had created for the wives and daughters of the men who worked in her husband's factory."<br><br>A college born from a glorified sewing circle, is how Christine put it once, a bit too loudly, at a freshman tea. But of course she doesn't say that to this assembly of women in their tailored linen skirts and pastel silk blouses, their Coach bags and sensible Ferragamo shoes. Penrose College may have originated from a socialist dream of aiding women from the underclasses, but it soon became a bastion of East Coast wealth and privilege.<br><br>"But before we accept that the Lady in the Window is merely a celebration of the medieval craftswoman," Christine continues, "let's review the social and artistic background of Augustus Penrose. His family owned a glass works in England, Penrose &amp; Sons, in Kelmscott, a small village on the Thames River near Oxford, which supplied medieval quality glass for stained-glass designers, including William Morris, the Pre-Raphaelite artist who also happened to live in Kelmscott. Young Augustus was particularly influenced by the opinions of William Morris, who believed that integrity ought to be restored to the decorative arts. When Simon Barovier, a wealthy factory owner from the north, purchased Penrose &amp; Sons, he encouraged young Augustus in his artistic pursuits--and so did Barovier's daughter, Eugenie, who fell in love with Augustus. As you know, the two married, and were sent by old Simon over to this country in the 1890s to found an American branch of the glass works. Augustus and Eugenie wanted to do more, though, than run a glass factory. Influenced by Morris's ideas, they were soon in the vanguard of the Arts &amp; Crafts Movement..."<br><br>Now that Christine has moved onto the firmer ground of her expertise in art history I let out a breath I hadn't known I was holding. I realize how nervous I am for her--how much I want this lecture to be a success for her--a comeback.<br><br>Back in college, Christine had a sort of glow about her--a radiant energy that drew people to her. We all believed she would go on to great things--even when she eschewed a PhD in favor of a job at a New York gallery and freelance writing on the arts. We thought then that she'd write a brilliant book or at least marry one of the famous artists she was often seen with at gallery openings. By the tenth reunion, when none of these things had happened and she got so drunk that she passed out during the Farewell Brunch, that glow of promise began to fade. Her name disappeared from the class notes; when I ran into people from the college that had known her they would ask after her with a solicitous edge of concern in their voices as if expecting to hear the worst. Sometimes, I suspected, hoping to hear the worst.<br><br>Many were surprised, then, when the programs for the fifteenth reunion arrived with the announcement that Christine would be delivering the lecture on the Lady window which the class of 1987 had elected to restore as their class gift. I wasn't, though, because I'd seen Christine through rehab four years ago and urged her to apply for a Penrose Grant, which supported alumnae who wanted to switch careers ten to twenty years out of college (the "second-chance" grant we often called it, a perfect prize for Christine who always managed to pull her act together at the last minute and shine brilliantly) so that she could go back to graduate school. I even suggested she make the window the subject of her thesis and when McKay Glass won the bid to do the restoration of the window--the first really big conservation project we've gotten since I convinced my father to expand into stained-glass restoration--I suggested to the college that Christine deliver this lecture. So you couldn't really blame me for being nervous for her.<br><br>While Christine's lecturing on the Pre-Raphaelites and Arts &amp; Crafts Movement (material I've heard before), I let my mind wander and my gaze shift to the window itself--brilliant now in the late afternoon sun. The upper half is dominated by a large rounded window--a window within a window--which frames a green pool carpeted with water lilies and shaded by a weeping beech. The view of mountains in the distance is the same as the view we would see if the window were clear--the deeply wooded hills of the Hudson Highlands on the western bank--still forested because Augustus Penrose bought up all the land on that side of the river for his mansion, Astolat. When Astolat burned down in the 1930s he and Eugenie moved back to Forest Hall, their house on this side of the river. All that's left of Astolat are the water gardens that Penrose designed--the centerpiece of which was a lily pool similar to the one depicted in the window.<br><br>Although the window is executed in opalescent glass and uses techniques made popular by Tiffany and LaFarge in the 1880s, the Lady herself could well be from a medieval window. Of course, as Christine is explaining now, the Pre-Raphaelites were in love with the Middle Ages--and in love with beautiful women with long flowing hair and expressions of abandon. This one has just looked up from her work. As she arches her back you can feel the strain of the long hours she has spent bending over her loom. A flush of color--skillfully produced by sanguine, a hematite-based paint used since the sixteenth century to enhance flesh tones--rises from her low-cut bodice up her long neck to the plane of her high cheekbones. It makes you wonder what she's been dreaming of over her loom.<br><br>"What I always wondered," Christine is saying now, "is why she is looking away from the window and why she has such a rapturous expression on her face. Her expression suggests some kind of revelation. Who is this weaver supposed to be? Remember that Augustus rarely painted his beloved Eugenie just as Eugenie. As the Pre-Raphaelite painters he admired had before him, Augustus often chose to depict his model in the guise of a figure from literature."<br><br>Christine presses a button on the speaker's dais and a slide screen unrolls on the wall to the right of the window and fills with an image of a young girl bending over a lily pool, her cascading hair turning into heavy branches that trail into the water, a sheath of bark just beginning to creep up her slim legs. "In fact, the only other work without a known mythological source is this one, The Drowning Tree, which seems to echo the tales of transformation Penrose was so fond of. He painted Eugenie as Daphne turning into a laurel as she flees from Apollo--" The Drowning Tree fades and is replaced with the more familiar image of the running girl sprouting leaves from her fingertips, "--and as the nymph Salmacis merging in her sacred pool with Hermaphroditus, and Halcyone turning into a kingfisher with her drowned husband..."<br><br>Christine clicks through one picture after another, naming each mythological or literary figure as the image appears and fades. She goes so quickly that the faces begin to blur together until we are left with the impression of one face--one woman appearing in many guises. Which is, of course, the impression Christine has been trying to create. They are all Eugenie--whether frightened as Daphne, lusting like Salmacis, or in the throes of shape-shifting like Halcyone. When the screen goes dark an image of that face--radiant, haloed by bright red gold hair--seems to burn on the blank screen for just an instant, glowing like the face in the stained glass-window.<br>"WHO, THEN, IS SHE--OUR LADY IN THE WINDOW? WHY, AFTER ALL THESE TALES OF transformation, would Augustus chose to depict Eugenie as some anonymous weaver in his last known portrait of her? To answer that question I ask you to notice the 'window' at her back. Many people have assumed that the landscape in the window depicts a view of the Hudson Highlands where Penrose built his grand estate, Astolat. But if you look carefully at the arrangement of ridges in the landscape,"--the flickering red arrow of Christine's laser pointer skims over the ridgelines in the window--"and compare them to the arrangement of hills in the actual landscape"--a photograph of the view across the river appears on the slide screen--"you will notice that the ridges are actually reversed. This is not a window--it's a mirror reflecting a window.<br><br>"And in what medieval story is a beautiful young maiden condemned to look at life only in its reflection? Why 'The Lady of Shalott' of course, Tennyson's version of an Arthurian legend. You probably remember it from Miss Ramsey's Nineteenth-century Lit class."<br><br>What I remember from Miss Ramsey's class was having to memorize Tennyson's endless ode to friendship, "In Memoriam." But as Christine outlines the story, "The Lady of Shalott" comes back to me: the enchanted maiden in her island tower, prohibited from looking directly at the world, weaving what she sees reflected in a mirror set opposite the window....<br><br>I look at the river landscape in the window and then at the scene unfolding in the Lady's loom. If this were the Lady of Shalott, they would be identical, but they are not. In fact the loom is blank. She seems to be weaving plain, unfigured cloth.<br><br>Still Christine makes a good argument for identifying the Lady in the Window with the heroine of Tennyson's poem. The name Augustus Penrose gave his mansion--Astolat--is an alternate name for Shalott. The pose of our Lady is similar to that of several Pre-Raphaelite Ladies of Shalott, as Christine demonstrates through a series of slides. She even has an explanation for why the scenes in the window and on the loom don't match. According to Eugenia Penrose's design notebook, the original painted panes for those sections were cracked during firing and had to be replaced by plain colored glass in order for the window to be ready in time for the library's dedication.</p><h2>Herb Mixtures &amp; Spicy Blends: Ethnic Flavorings, No-Salt Blends, Marinades/Dressings, Butters/Spreads, Dessert Mixtures, Teas/Mulling Spices</h2><p>Create handmade mixtures of your favorite herbs and spices that add a delicious new zing to your favorite dishes.

The collection shows humans interacting with dinosaurs and various other &#39;monsters&#39; such as horned men. Both Hapgood and Earl Stanley Gardner were convinced that the figurines from Acambaro were authentic ancient artifacts that indicated that men and dinosaurs had cohabited together in the recent past, and that dinosaurs had not become extinct many millions of years ago as commonly thought. David Hatcher Childress writes a lengthy introduction concerning Acambaro, the latest testing, and other evidence of &#39;living&#39; dinosaurs.</p><p>Charles Hapgood was a professor at the University of New Hampshire and wrote numerous books, including Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings, which won an Amazon.com award for Best Atlas.</p><h2>Running from the Deity: A Pip &amp; Flinx Adventure (Adventures of Pip &amp; Flinx)</h2><p><b>From science fiction legend Alan Dean Foster comes a thrilling Pip and Flinx adventure, wherein a certain red-haired, green-eyed young man blessed (or cursed) with strange powers finds himself and his mini-dragon sidekick on a top-secret mission concerning deep space, alien worlds . . . and a primordial horror intent on devouring all of it.</b><br><br> In the outer depths of the universe lies the Great Emptiness, where something dreadful lurks, hidden behind a great gravitational lens of dark matter. Something horrific that howls and writhes and rages across three hundred million light-years of space&#x2013;and is now heading straight for the Commonwealth and moving faster all the time.<br><br> One slim chance exists to avert catastrophe, and only Flinx can take it. Roaming the galaxy is a conscious planet-size weapons system, the legacy of a long-extinct race. As Flinx is the only one who has ever experienced mental contact with the machine, it is his job to find the powerful alien artifact and coax it into joining the battle against the behemoth from beyond.<br><br> So Pip and Flinx valiantly sail into the unknown aboard their little spaceship, which is immediately forced down for emergency repairs on planet Arrawd, home to less advanced sentients and therefore off-limits to space travelers. But what with Arrawd being very beautiful, and Flinx being Flinx, this particular rule doesn&#x2019;t stand a chance.<br><br> Now, Flinx is no stranger to murderous attacks and stalking assassins&#x2014;evading them occupies most of his waking hours&#x2013;but to be besieged by hordes bent on worshipping him as a god? Worse still, escaping this fate is going to be as impossible as fulfilling his dire mission.

He is the author of the New York Times bestseller Star Wars: The Approaching Storm, as well as novelizations of several films, including Star Wars, the first three Alien films, and Alien Nation. His novel Cyber Way won the Southwest Book Award for Fiction in 1990, the first science fiction work ever to do so.<b> </b>Foster and his wife, JoAnn Oxley, live in Prescott, Arizona, in a house built of brick that was salvaged from an early-twentieth-century miners&#x2019; brothel. He is currently at work on several new novels and media projects.At first thought, you'd think it would be easy to find a missing planet. Even a methane dwarf. Except that the missing tenth world of the outlying Imperial AAnn system of Pyrassis was not a world, but an immense automated weapons platform of the long-extinct race who called themselves the Tar-Aiym.<br><br> Actually, Flinx mused as he held out his arms and let the magnetically charged droplets of water swirl around him and scrub his lanky naked form, one would think it would be even simpler to find a planet-sized weapons platform than a small planet itself. The only problem was that in the absence of standing orders to guide its revived behavior, the monstrous ancient device had gone looking for some. Since to the best of current knowledge the last of those beings who might be capable of issuing such directives had died half a million years earlier, more or less, the prospects of said intelligent weapons platform stumbling across relevant instructions on how it ought to proceed were slight indeed. Flinx suspected that it would do no good, should he somehow actually succeed in tracking down his galactically perambulating quarry, to point out that the species it was built to fight, the Hur'rikku, were as dead and gone as the massive machine's original Tar-Aiym builders.<br><br> Find it first, he told himself as he did a slow turn beneath the recycled spray from the shower. Semantics follow function.<br><br> He did not need to pivot for purposes of cleanliness since the water beads automatically enveloped him in their attentive aqueous embrace. They avoided only the special shower mask that shielded his mouth and nose. Without such a mask, someone making use of such a shower conceivably could drown--though it was an easy enough matter simply to step sideways and clear of the open-sided, freestanding facility.<br><br> "Are you finished yet?" The voice of the Teacher's ship-mind reached him through the stimulating vertical bath.<br><br> "Almost. Why? Are you going to suggest that after I finish bathing I take another 'vacation'?"<br><br> "It is interesting how sardonicism tends to shed efficacy over time," the ship-mind replied tartly. Having suggested that Flinx spend a while resting and recuperating on the out-of-the-way world of Jast, only to see him nearly murdered by one of the expatriate AAnn officials residing on that world, the AI was understandably disinclined to discuss the subject. Knowing this, Flinx lost few opportunities to bring it up.<br><br> "I take your point, by which I assume that you're not going to make such a suggestion. Good."<br><br> As he stepped out of the shower, the ready and waiting dryer scanned his dripping body. Preprogrammed to his specified level of individual comfort, it set about evaporating from his skin the water and the dirt it had englobed. Standing there, alone in his personal hygienic facilities within the ship, Flinx contemplated his immediate future and regarded it as fraught with uncertainty, danger, and confusion.<br><br> Not that it had ever been otherwise.<br><br> Some days he chose to dress while at other times he moved about the Teacher's interior quite naked. As the only human on board, there was no need to concern himself with violating nudity taboos. Pip certainly did not mind. Rising from the resting place where she had dozed in utter indifference to her master's peculiar habit of immersing himself in gravity-defying liquid, she landed on his bare right shoulder and settled down. Her slender serpentine shape was warm against his freshly scoured skin.<br><br> Pulling on lightweight pants and a feathery comfort shirt, he made his way to the Teacher's bridge. Around him, the product of the Ulru-Ujurrian's creative engineering genius functioned smoothly. It would have been dead silent inside the ship, except that dead silence smacked too much of death itself. So at present, and in response to his latest request, the hush was broken by the soft sounds of a Sek-takenabdel cantata. Like many of his kind, Flinx was quite fond of the often atonal yet oddly soothing traditional thranx music, which in this particular composition sounded like nothing less than lullabies sung by angry, but muted, electrified cimbaloms.<br><br> As the ship sped at unnatural velocity through the nebulosity of higher mathematics colloquially known as space-plus, Flinx settled into the single command chair to gaze moodily through the sweeping, curved forward port. Though shifted over into the ultraviolet by the ship's KK-drive posigravity field, the view of the distorted universe surrounding him was, as always, still spectacularly beautiful. Pulsars and novae illuminated nebulae while distant galaxies vied for prominence with nearby suns.<br><br> Meanwhile, out beyond it all, in the direction of the constellation Bootes, something unimaginably vast and malevolent was coming out of a region known as the Great Emptiness, threatening not merely the Commonwealth and civilization, but everything within his field of view. His mental field of view, he reminded himself. Hence the need, however hopeless the notion of fighting something so immense and alien, to find allies. Such as, just possibly, the primeval weapons platform that had for millennia masqueraded as the tenth planet of the system known as Pyrassis.<br><br> Thinking of it made him want to go stand and soak beneath another shower.<br><br> A reaction as ineffectual as it was childish, he knew. He could no more wash away the distinct memory of the evil he knew was out there than he could that of his troubled childhood, his subsequent erratic maturation, and the pressure to succeed that had been placed on him by his good friends and mentors Bran Tse-Mallory and the Eint Truzenzuzex. Just as with his unstable, if escalating and potentially fatal Talent, he could not wish such things away.<br><br> He stared out at the universe and the universe stared right back, indifferent. Exactly how was he supposed to go about finding the wandering planet-sized Tar-Aiym device? The brilliant Truzenzuzex and the insightful Tse-Mallory had been unable to give him much advice. Since he was the only one who had experienced (or suffered, he corrected himself) mental contact with the machine, it was hoped that if he deliberately went looking for it he might make such contact with it again. Strike up a casual conversation with an all-powerful alien artifact, it was supposed.<br><br> And, he mused, in the unlikely event that he did? How to convince such a relic to participate in the defense of the galaxy. Nothing of overweening importance--just your average galaxy, in which he, and everyone he knew, happened to live. Reposing in the chair, he shook his head dolefully though there were none present to note the gesture save Pip and ship.<br><br> "I don't see how I can do what Bran and Tru asked," he muttered aloud. He did not need to explain himself. Ship-mind knew.<br><br> "If you cannot, then no one can," it replied unhelpfully. As befitted its programming, it was doing its best to be supportive.<br><br> "A distinct and even likely possibility," he murmured to no one and nothing in particular. He glanced in the direction of the main readout. "We're still on course--if you can call heading in a general direction hundreds of parsecs in extent a 'course.'"<br><br> As usual, the Teacher sounded more relaxed when responding to specifics of ship operation than it did when trying to understand the often unfathomable complexities of human thought and behavior.<br><br> "We have re-entered the Commonwealth on intent to cross vector three-five-four, accelerating in space-plus on course to leave Commonwealth boundaries beyond Almaggee space, subsequent to entering the Sagittarius Arm and the region collectively known as the Blight."<br><br> The Blight, Flinx thought. Home to long-vanished species among whom were the ancient Tar-Aiym and Hur'rikku. The Blight: an immense swath of space once flourishing with inhabited worlds much of which had been rendered dead and sterile by the photonic plague unleashed by the Tar-Aiym on their ancient Hur'rikku enemies half a million years ago. Like those who had hastily and unwisely propounded it, the all-destroying plague had long since consumed itself, leaving in its wake only empty skies gazing forlornly down on dead worlds. Here and there, in a few spatial corners miraculously passed over by the plague, life had survived. Life, and memories of the all-consuming horror that had inexplicably skipped over them. No wonder the inhabitants of such isolated yet fortunate systems gazed up at the night sky with fear instead of expectation, and clung tightly to their isolated home systems.<br><br> Somewhere within that immense and largely vacant chunk of cosmos, the re-energized Tar-Aiym weapons platform had gone searching for instructions. Hunting for those who had made it. That there were none such to be found anywhere any longer was not sufficient to discourage it from looking. Such was the way of the machine mind. A mind he somehow had to make contact with once again. A mind he had somehow to persuade.<br><br> A hard task it was going to be, if he continued to have trouble convincing himself that the enterprise he was engaged in had not even the remotest chance of success.<br><br> When applied to most people, the expression have an open mind was merely rhetorical. Not so with Flinx. In fact, for much of his life he had prayed for the ability to have one that was closed. Intermittently and uncontrollably exposed to the emotions of any and every sentient around him, he threatened to drown in a sea of sentiment and sensation whenever he visited a developed world. Feelings flooded in on him in endless waves of exhilaration, despair, hope, remorse, anger, love, and everything in between. With each passing year he seemed to become more sensitive, more alert to those inner expressions of thinking beings. Not long ago, he had unexpectedly acquired the ability to project as well as receive emotions. This capability had proven useful in his search for the truth of his origins as well as in escaping those who intended him harm.<br><br> Yet for all his escalating skills, he had yet to learn how to master them. Defined by their erraticism, he had long ago decided that they might forever be beyond his control. That did not keep him from trying. Not only because a Talent that was wild was of far less usefulness than one that could be managed, but because the severe headaches he had suffered from since adolescence continued to grow more frequent, and more intense. His ability might be his savior--as well as that of billions of other sentient beings. It might also kill him. He had no choice but to continue wrestling with it, and with what he was, because he was special.<br><br> He would have given up everything just to be normal.<br><br> Sensing her master's melancholy, Pip rose from her resting place on his shoulder, the deep-throated humming of her wings louder than the ambient music that was being played by the Teacher. Circling him twice, she settled down on his other shoulder, wings furled tightly against her slim, brightly colored body. Wrapping herself around the back of his neck, she squeezed gently and affectionately, trying to reassure him. Reaching up with his left hand, he absently stroked the back of her head. Small slitted eyes closed in contentment. Alaspinian minidrags did not purr, but the strength of the empathetic bond between him and his scaly companion managed to convey something like the emotional equivalent.<br><br> Leaning back in the command chair, Flinx closed his own eyes and tried to open his unique mind further, to reach outward in all directions. Though he could readily identify the target he sought, he could not have defined with precision the exact nature of what it was that he was searching for. But, like the caressing hand of a beautiful woman, he would know it when he felt it. Out, out, away from the ship, away from himself, he searched. His field of perception was an expanding balloon. But no matter how much he relaxed, even with Pip's aid he sensed nothing. Only emptiness.<br><br> Occasionally, as the Teacher drove onward through the outer reaches of the Commonwealth, his Talent was tickled by sparks of sentience. A flash of feeling from distant Tipendemos and, later, stronger bursts of emotion out of Almaggee. Then, more nothingness as he left the region of developed systems and sped through space-plus toward the Blight.<br><br> There were worlds in that vast section of the Sagittarius Arm that had once been inhabited, and worlds that were habitable still. No doubt someday, as the human and thranx population continued to expand in every direction, those worlds would once again resound to the voices of sentience. But not for a while yet. The Commonwealth itself encompassed an enormous section of space replete with hundreds of worlds yet to be settled or even explored by robotic probes. However enticing, the ancient worlds of the Blight would have to wait.<br><br> In its search for those who had built it, the wandering Tar-Aiym weapons platform would have hundreds of square parsecs in which to roam without encountering intelligent life of any kind. Making contact with anything in so vast a place seemed impossible. What swayed Flinx to try was the imploring of those wiser than himself. That, and the fact that on more than one occasion in his short life he had already achieved the impossible.<br><br> Having more or less resolved in his own mind to at least attempt the search, the last thing he expected as he entered the Blight was to have his resolution temporarily countermanded by his own ship.<br><br> He was taking his ease, as he so often did, in the central lounge. With its malleable waterfalls and pond, its fountain that sent heavy water trickling down and light water floating upward as decorative bubbles, it was far and away the most relaxing part of the unique vessel. Hailing from many worlds, the lush greenery that now packed every corner of the carefully maintained chamber filled it with wondrous scents and extra oxygen. Of course, he could have achieved a similar effect by simply directing the ship-mind to alter the composition of the internal atmosphere. But artificially regenerated oxygen lacked the subtle smells that accompanied air exhaled by growing things. Merely reclining among the running water and miniature forest helped him to unwind, and allowed his mind to roam free of anxiety and headaches. Green, he reflected, was good for the soul.<br><br> Nearby, Pip was pursuing something through the underbrush. It was harmless, or it would not be on board the ship. It was also confined to the lounge area. Chasing such harmless bits of decorative ambulatory life gave her something to do.<br><br> Unlike me, he thought.<br><br> "There is a problem."<br><br> Reluctantly, he bestirred himself from daydreaming of warm beaches on a recently visited world, and the passionate company he had kept there. "If you're trying to astonish me with revelation, you need to choose a less recurrent subject."<br><br> Ignoring the cynicism, the Teacher continued. "You are not the only one who suffers from stress, Philip Lynx."<br><br> Frowning, he rolled over on the supportive lounge. "Don't tell me that you're having mental problems. That's supposed to be my area of expertise."</p><h2>Behind the Scenes: or, Thirty Years a Slave, and Four Years in the White House (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>Originally published in 1868&#x2014;when it was attacked as an &#x201c;indecent book&#x201d; authored by a &#x201c;traitorous eavesdropper&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Behind the Scenes</b> is the story of Elizabeth Keckley, who began her life as a slave and became a privileged witness to the presidency of Abraham Lincoln. Keckley bought her freedom at the age of thirty-seven and set up a successful dressmaking business in Washington, D.C. She became modiste to Mary Todd Lincoln and in time her friend and confidante, a relationship that continued after Lincoln&#x2019;s assassination. In documenting that friendship&#x2014;often using the First Lady&#x2019;s own letters&#x2014;<b>Behind the Scenes</b> fuses the slave narrative with the political memoir. It remains extraordinary for its poignancy, candor, and historical perspective.<ul><li><p>First time in Penguin Classics</p></li></ul></p><p>Only a few years later, however, that relationship was in ruins, when this 1868 book created a scandal. Intended by Keckley to rehabilitate the reputation of the former First Lady--who had run up extensive debts on clothing and other luxuries while in the White House, and found herself unable to repay them after the President's assassination--the book was perceived instead as a betrayal of friendship. <p> Perhaps one of the first examples of celebrity gossip publishing gone awry, Behind the Scenes does, nevertheless, offer an insider perspective on the Lincoln White House that will intrigue armchair historians and fans of biography alike.</p>Elizabeth Hobbs Keckley (1818&#x2013;1907) was born a slave near Dinwiddie Court House, Virginia, and, after purchasing her freedom, became head of the Domestic Science Department at Wilberforce University in Ohio.<br>William L.

Yet after his death a largely negative image of the man himself took hold; he has been portrayed as a racist, a misogynist and a narcissist. Now Larkin scholar James Booth, for seventeen years a colleague of the poet&#x2019;s at the University of Hull, offers a very different portrait. Drawn from years of research and a wide variety of Larkin&#x2019;s friends and correspondents, this is the most comprehensive portrait of the poet yet published.</p><p>Booth traces the events that shaped Larkin in his formative years, from his early life when his his political instincts were neutralised by exposure to his father&#x2019;s controversial Nazi values. He studies how the academic environment and the competition he felt with colleagues such as Kingsley Amis informed not only Larkin&#x2019;s poetry, but also his little-known ambitions as a novelist. </p><p>Through the places and people Larkin encountered over the course of his life, including Monica Jones, with whom he had a tumultuous but enduring relationship, Booth pieces together an image of a rather reserved and gentle man, whose personality&#x2015;and poetry--have been misinterpreted by decades of academic study. <i>Philip Larkin: Life, Art and Love</i> reveals the man behind the words as he has never been seen before.</p></p><p><b>James Booth</b> is the literary adviser and coeditor of the Philip Larkin Society. He is the author of two studies of Larkin's work, <i>Philip Larkin: Writer in 1991</i> and <i>Philip Larkin: The Poet's Plight</i>. He has also edited a collection of Larkin's early girls' school stories and poems and a volume of critical essays, <i>New Larkins for Old</i>. He has recently retired from the Department of English at the University of Hull, where he was a colleague of Larkin's for seventeen years.&#x201c;Booth shows Larkin's variety, from near-religious adoration to lasciviousness to slashingly witty...

A great philosopher, a great preacher, a great theologian. Edwards was a complex and gifted person, one who defies easy characterization.&nbsp;He intimidates us, and we distance ourselves from him because at the most fundamental level, he&#x2019;s just not like us.<br><br>It is of course true that Jonathan Edwards was a combination of many rare things: an exceptional intellectual, a masterly preacher, a cavernous theologian, a devoted husband and father, a college president, and much more. But all of these roles flowed out of one simple and essential reality:&nbsp;Jonathan Edwards was a Christian. He was a believer who followed Jesus Christ in repentant faith. He loved God, and he sought to live for Him.<br><br>This book celebrates the unique life and ministry of Jonathan Edwards. It peels back the cover of his life, to show us what a life devoted to our sovereign Lord can look like. It causes us to use our own God-given gifts for the salvation of sinners, the strengthening of God&#x2019;s church, and the glory of God. You do not need to be a scholar to enjoy and benefit from the story and rich lessons about Edwards' life.</p><p><b>OWEN STRACHAN</b> is Associate Professor of Christian Theology at Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary.

A few days later, all that changed, when she was rushed to the emergency room with a case of acute and life-threatening pancreatitis. Being ill, she discovered, forces you to learn to live in whole new ways, ones often marked by limitation and fragility.</p> <p>As a priest and spiritual director, Earle began to explore ways in which her own prayer life might help her build a different relationship with her illness. Using the Benedictine practice of lectio divina, or sacred reading, she began to "read" her own illness, and discovered a way of befriending and helping to heal--if not cure--her body and her life.</p> <p>In <em>Broken Body, Healing Spirit</em>, Earle introduces this strategy to others who are hungry to find ways of living more fully despite chronic or serious illness or pain. Her practical, step-by-step approach to "reading the text of our illnesses," and learning to listen to what our bodies are trying to tell us will be of help to those who are currently suffering with disease or limitations, as well as to those who are caregivers and counselors.</p></p><p>Mary C. Earle is a spiritual director, writer, and Episcopal priest who leads retreats and workshops. She is the co-author of <i>Praying with the Celtic Saints</i>, and her poetry has appeared in a variety of journals and anthologies. Mary is an adjunct faculty member in spirituality at the Episcopal Theological Seminary of the Southwest in Austin, Texas, and assistant rector at St. Mark's Episcopal Church in San Antonio.</p><h2>Crooked Little Heart: A Novel</h2><p>With the same winning combination of humor and honesty that marked her recent nonfiction bestsellers, Operating Instructions and Bird by Bird, Anne Lamott's new novel gives us an exuberant, richly absorbing portrait of a family for whom the joys and sorrows of everyday life are magnified under the glare of the unexpected.<br><br>Rosie Ferguson, in the first bloom of young womanhood, is obsessed with tournament tennis. Her mother is a recovering alcoholic still grieving the death of her first husband; her stepfather, a struggling writer, is wrestling with his own demons. And now Rosie finds that her athletic gifts, once a source of triumph and escape, place her in peril, as a shadowy man who stalks her from the bleachers seems to be developing an obsession of his own...</p><p>At 13, Rosie plays a gangly, pigeon-toed second fiddle to her juicy, sexy friend Simone. The two are junior tennis champs who often cart home trophies. But driven by the gnawing fear that she's a loser, Rosie starts to cheat. Meantime, boy-crazy Simone dabbles in off-court disaster. Up in the bleachers a weird loner named Luther obsessively follows Rosie's games, while at home her mother wrestles her own demons. Anne Lamott (<i>Operating Instructions</i>) has turned in a fair depiction of the blood and bones of adolescence that's thankfully leavened by sharp humor and transcendent moments. The novel is uneven and heavy-handed at times, but often rewarding.Here's a sample of the advance praise that poured into Pantheon's offices recently:<p>"<b>Crooked Little Heart</b> is pure Anne Lamott, with her marvelous, unique and totally original voice, so warm and welcoming, kind, and always so wonderfully, reliably, funny."<br>-- Alice Adams</p><p>"With <b>Crooked Little Heart</b>, Anne Lamott deserves to be called the Subconscious of America. She's the two-way mirror of our hopes, insecurities, and cheating hearts. She's the astute observer of human nature. She knows that what we don't know can hurt us. In true Lamott fashion, life doesn't stay neatly within boundaries, the best team doesn't always win, and only the voyeur knows who you really are. Fathers die, mothers drink, and an infected pimple can kill you or at least ruin your chances in junior high school. But there's also this: love, redemption, and the certainty that life goes on. <b>Crooked Little Heart</b> is absolutely brilliant."<br>-- Amy Tan</p><p>"Anne Lamott is at the top of her form in this complex coming-of-age novel in which tennis becomes the metaphor for life's toughest lessons."<br>-- Sue Grafton</p></p><h2>MGB Electrical Systems (The Essential Buyer&#39;s Guide)</h2><p>This book is essential reading for every MGB enthusiast. The mechanical aspects and the restoration of these vehicles have been written about before, but the so often maligned electrical systems has never been comprehensively covered.<br><br> For those new to vehicle electrical systems, <i>MGB Electrical Systems</i> provides a simple primer using mechanical analogies. Each system in the car has its own chapter, and feature simple, uncluttered circuit diagrams where each wire is visible and accurately colored.<br><br> More than a how-to-do guide, the book also explains the "why" of each system and procedure, aiding diagnostics when things don&#x2019;t go quite as they should.<br></p><p><p>An electrical engineer, Rick Astley was born and educated in England. Tight budgets and a need to get to work meant he soon developed a thorough working knowledge of the many used British cars he owned; cars he later restored to an acceptable level of reliability.&nbsp; Even though his professional life took him to Canada and eventually to the USA, where he now lives, through membership of his local MG club he has maintained his interest in the British cars of his youth. Rick now works part-time as an electrical engineering consultant in the Motor City of Detroit.</p>Overall an excellent book, and this revised edition enhances what was already a great addition to an MG owner&#39;s bookshelf. Priced at GBP40 it&#39;s not cheap, but in my opinion worth every penny and an essential read for MGB enthusiast. Safety Fast. The most apparent update is more pictures and since a picture is worth a thousand words, well, then there are an extra million or two words worth of advice in the book. Every chapter in the book seems to have been expanded and improved. This book is much more that a &#34;how to&#34; book. It explains why the component works the way it does, how you can make improvements or modernise, and - most importantly - it is very easy to understand. This book is essential for MGB and MGC owners because of the time it will save chasing down electrical issues. - MGB Driver.</p><h2>Retribution (Dark-Hunter Novels, 15)</h2><p><p><b>Retribution</b></p><p><b>Sherrilyn Kenyon </b></p><p>Orphaned as a child and raised by vampires, Abigail Yager lives for one purpose, and one purpose only: To avenge the deaths of vampires everywhere.

Gone were complicated passwords, deadly dames in black velvet, and dashing aristocratic secret agents. Here, instead, was what Howard Haycraft, the genre&#x2019;s first historian, termed &#x201c;a mood of subtle understatement,&#x201d; calling Drink to Yesterday and its immediate sequel, A Toast to Tomorrow, &#x201c;superior&#x201d; examples of this revamped genre. Drink to Yesterday was based on the early life of one of its two collaborators, Cyril Henry Coles, who left school, lied about his age and enlisted as a teenager in the British army during World War I. He was transferred to intelligence when his remarkable aptitude for conversational German was noticed, and he became the youngest member of Britain&#x2019;s Foreign Intelligence Office (later MI6). Like Bill Saunders of the book, Coles spent much of the rest of war working behind enemy lines. Coles and his collaborator, a Hampshire neighbor, Adelaide Oke Manning, chose to cast his story in the form of the novel so as not to run afoul of the Official Secrets Act. Grimmer than later books in the series, it&#x2019;s also an ingenious circular story of murder, enlivened by the sardonic humor of Bill&#x2019;s mentor, Tommy Hambledon.</p><p>Drink to Yesterday and A Toast to Tomorrow forms &#34;a single long and magnificent novel of intrigue, drama and humor.&#34; -- Anthony Boucher &#34;New York Times&#34;</p><h2>Wildflower Postcard Book</h2><p><p>Artist Lucile Parker often used a magnifying glass to grasp every detail of the wildflowers she illustrated in this postcard book.

Since the first contact between natives and settlers, tribes like the Sioux, Cherokee, and Navajo have both fascinated and perplexed outsiders with their history, language, and culture. In Charles River Editors&#x2019; Native American Tribes series, readers can get caught up to speed on the history and culture of North America&#x2019;s most famous native tribes in the time it takes to finish a commute, while learning interesting facts long forgotten or never known. <br> Among all the Native American tribes, the Iroquois people are some of the most well documented Native Americans in history. Indigenous to the northeast region of what is now the United States and parts of Canada, they were among some of the earliest contacts Europeans had with the native tribes. And yet they have remained a constant source of mystery. <br> The name "Iroquois", like many Native American tribal names, is not a name the people knew themselves by, but a word applied to them by their enemies the Huron, who called them &#x201c;Iroquo&#x201d; (rattlesnake) as an insult. The French later added the suffix &#x201c;ois.&#x201d; Moreover, the Iroquois are not even a single tribe but a confederation of several different tribal nations that include the Seneca, Oneida, Onondaga, Mohawk, Cayuga and the Tuscarora, who didn&#x2019;t become part of the union until the early 1700&#x2019;s. The name Haudenosaunee (pronounced &#x201c;ho-den-oh-SHO-nee&#x201d;) is the name the people use for themselves, which translates as &#x201c;the People of the Longhouse.&#x201d; They are also commonly known as the Six Nations. <br> Despite their own cultural differences, the nations that comprised the Iroquois Confederacy established their political dominance across much of America&#x2019;s East Coast and Midwest through conquest, and it is that aspect which has perhaps best endured among Americans in terms of the Iroquois&#x2019; legacy. European settlers who came into contact with the Mohawks in the Northeast certainly learned to respect their combat skills, to the point that there were literally bounties on the Mohawks&#x2019; heads, with scalps fetching money for colonists who succeeded in slaying them and carrying away the &#x201c;battle prize&#x201d;. <br> In addition to the constant state of conflict between the Iroquois and different nations, including the French and the colonists, the Six Nations are perhaps best known for their political structure, and their influence on American democracy is well documented if not well known by most Americans. <br> Far from being relics of history, they are living communities who maintain political relationships with United States and Canada, as they have occupied their territories long before international borders were drawn. Their histories have left an indelible mark on the formation of the United States and Canada. Native American Tribes: The History and Culture of the Iroquois Confederacy comprehensively covers the culture and history of the Six Nations. Along with pictures depicting the Iroquois, you will learn about the Iroquois like you never have before, in no time at all.</p><p></p><h2>The Quiet Way: A Christian Path to Inner Peace (Spiritual Classics)</h2><p>The profound spiritual counsel of the 18th century German Protestant lay theologian, pastor, and mystic Gerhard Tersteegen is presented in this volume in the form of short selections from 100 of his letters.</p><p>Gerhard Tersteegen was born in Moers, Germany in 1697. As a young man he gave up his life as a successful merchant and moved into an isolated cottage in order to search for God. In 1727 a revival took place and what started as a journey of solitude took a new direction as people began coming to him for spiritual guidance. Before long he was giving personal counsel from morning to night. The numbers seeking his guidance grew to the point that he was forced to move into a house to better accommodate them. In 1731 he published his first collection of hymns, The Spiritual Flower Garden. These hymns were so popular that they were sung at weddings, social gatherings, and even spoken as greetings. Thousands came to Tersteegen for spiritual counsel, many traveling great distances and sometimes waiting for hours in order to hear his words for a few minutes. He taught that God&#39;s nature is in every man and it has only become obscured by focus on outward things. All who seek the &#34;kingdom of Heaven&#34; from within will find great joy his words."It is a little thing for Him to let us find in our souls in one moment, without any trouble, what we may have been seeking for years with such trouble outside ourselves." --page 6 <p>"In short, I realize more and more that what I do is unavailing, but everything avails when I let God do it." --page 8 </p><p>"Prayer is looking at God, who is ever present, and letting Him look on us." --page 22 </p><p>"There are many ways, means, and preparations, whereby we may gain reunion and fellowship with God. But the nearest way of all, and the easiest means, yes, the tiny point where this union is actually achieved, is when we become little children. The Son of God became one with mankind as a child, and mankind can only be united to God in the state of spiritual childhood. And, indeed, dear sister, the baby Jesus constrains us once again to enter with Him into the most perfect innocence of the childlike mind. So, away with all scruples, brooding, suspicion, unrest, and all lovelessness." --page 31</p></p><h2>Perfect Blend</h2><p>(Shawnee Press). It will make you think. It will make you laugh.

There the sordid inclinations of both the working class and aristocracy may be found&#x2014;and there, Jeremy learns that the girl&#x2019;s mother has disappeared near the racetrack. As he delves further into the mystery, he will begin to realize just how high the stakes are, and&#x2014;when an acquaintance of his own suddenly vanishes&#x2014;just how terribly steep the odds really are.</p><p><b>Bruce Alexander</b> is the pseudonym for a well-known journalist and author of fiction and nonfiction. He was the author of the Sir John Fielding historical mysteries, including&nbsp;<i>Murder in Grub Street</i>, which was&nbsp;named a notable book by&nbsp;the <i>New York Times Book Review</i>&nbsp;in 1995.In Alexander's 10th enjoyable Sir John Fielding novel set in Georgian England (after 2002's An Experiment in Treason), the brilliant blind magistrate and his young apprentice Jeremy Proctor investigate the brutal murder of a little girl whose mother had sold her into slavery. The trail leads Jeremy into a new world, the racetrack, as he joins forces with the victim's uncle, legendary jockey Deuteronomy Plummer. The challenges of the inquiry mount, as crucial witnesses turn up dead and evidence suggests that a member of the upper class is involved. The assistance of Jeremy's almost-fiancee, Clarissa Roundtree, proves vital when her childhood friend Elizabeth Hooker disappears only to resurface after a melodramatic escape from a brothel-a subplot borrowed from a celebrated real-life unsolved mystery. As with other recent entries in this fine series, the once-dominant Sir John plays a largely supporting role. His sage advice and struggle to serve justice in a corrupt milieu guide his assistant's growth and maturation. This shift also mirrors a trend to underplay the whodunit aspect. Routine police procedure has largely supplanted Holmesian deductive pyrotechnics. Restoring the old balance by adding to Jeremy's sleuthing skills in future entries might win more classic mystery fans. FYI: The subplot, based on the unexplained disappearance of a young woman named Elizabeth Canning, takes center stage in Josephine Tey's The Franchise Affair (1948) and is "solved" in Lillian De La Torre's Elizabeth Is Missing (1945). Arthur Machen's The Canning Wonder (1926) provides the definitive nonfiction account.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ken Howard a Personal View: Inspired by Light (Atelier Series)</h2><p>Ken Howard is renowned for his ability to portray the subtle nuances of light. Here he explains how light has been a never-ending source of inspiration for his art and reveals some of the secrets of his craft. Illustrated throughout with the artist&#39;s wonderfully evocative sketches, watercolors and oil paintings, this is a unique insight into the work of this internationally acclaimed artist.</p><p>Inspiration may be the most important element in the psyche of an artist. These volumes represent three widely different sources of inspiration, one from the spiritual world of Zen, another from the personal guidance of an accomplished mentor, and the last from the wildest reaches of the imagination. Carbonetti had a surprise hit with her first book, The Tao of Watercolor. This one may also find a wide audience, despite its rather superficial use of Zen. It is a bold attempt, but those seriously interested in Eastern religion as artistic inspiration will be disappointed. Howard is a master of light in both watercolor and oil. Appointed Official Artist in Northern Ireland and a member of the Royal Academy, he is a stimulating teacher with strong views. Going from the sublime to the hideous, Jefferies's book on fantasy art will either stimulate the imagination or provoke nightmares. His is one of the best manuals for creating beasts, angels, demons, wizards, and cursed castles. He even gives tips on making maps for lands where your creatures can roam. Three good volumes, each sure to find an audience. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>AVA</h2><p><p>Ava Klein, thirty-nine, lover of life, world traveler, professor of comparative literature, is dying. From her hospital bed on this, her last day on earth, she makes one final ecstatic voyage. People, places, offhand memories, and imaginary things drift in and out of Ava's consciousness and weave their way through the narrative. The voices of her three former husbands emerge: Francesco, a filmmaker from Rome; Anatole, lost in the air over France; Carlos, a teenager from Granada. The ways people she loved expressed themselves in letters or at the beach or at the moment of desire return to her. There is Danilo, her current lover, a Czech novelist, and others, lovers of one night, as she sings the endless, joyous, erotic song cycles of her life, because "Dusk and the moment right before shapes are taken back is erotic. And the dark."</p><p>The voices of her literary loves as well are woven into the narrative: Woolf, Eliot, Nabokov, Beckett, Sarraute, Lorca, Frisch, among others. These writers comment on and help guide us through the text. We hear the voices of her parents, who survived the Treblinka death camp, and of her Aunt Sophie, who did not. War permeates the text, for on Ava Klein's last day Iraq has invaded Kuwait. And above all we hear Ava's voice. Hers is the voice of pleasure, of astonishment, the voice of regret, the voice of gratitude as she moves closer and closer to the "music that is silence."</p><p>"AVA" is an attempt, in the words of French feminist philosopher Helene Cixous, "to come up with a language that heals as much as it separates." The fragments of the novel are combined to make a new kind of wholeness, allowing environments, states of mind, and rhythms not ordinarily associated with fiction to emerge. "AVA"'s theme is the poignancy of mortality, the extraordinary desire to live, the inevitability of death--the things never done, never understood, the things never said, or said right, or said enough. Ava yearns and the reader yearns with her, struggling to hold on to all that slips away.</p></p><p>This haunting novel questions the border between poetry and prose. Ava Klein, lover of life and professor of comparative literature, is dying. On this her last day, she recalls her experiences in unique and lyrical detail; a meditation on war, an ode to joy, a celebration of life. Helene Cixous praises <b>AVA</b> as incorporating "a language that heals as much as it separates." <i>Publishers Weekly</i> called it "heartbreakingly familiar emotions in an utterly original form."Carole Maso is author of the novels AVA, The American Woman in the Chinese Hat, Ghost Dance, The Art Lover, and Defiance. She has also written several books of nonfiction. Maso is a professor of Literary Arts at Brown University.</p><h2>After the Tall Timber: Collected Nonfiction</h2><p>What is really going on here? For decades Renata Adler has been asking and answering this question with unmatched urgency.&nbsp; As a staff writer at <i>The New Yorker</i>. Adler reported on civil rights from Selma, Alabama; the wars in Biafra, and the Middle East; the Nixon impeachment inquiry; cultural life in Cuba. She also reported on politics and culture in the United States, films (as chief film critic for <i>The New York Times</i>), books,&nbsp; television,&nbsp; pop music, the press. She has taken risks in order to give us the news, not the "news" we have become accustomed to--celebrity journalism, conventional wisdom, received ideas--but the actual story, an account unfettered by ideology or consensus, when too many other writers have joined the pack. The more recent pieces are concerned with, in her words, "misrepresentation, coercion, and abuse of public process, and, to a degree, the journalist's role in it.". Adler brilliantly unravels the tangled narratives that pass for the resolution of scandal and finds the threads that others miss, the ones that explain what really is going on --from the Watergate scandal, to the "preposterous" Kenneth Starr report during the Clinton impeachment inquiry, and the story of then <i>New York Times</i> reporter Jayson Blair. She writes brilliantly too about the Supreme Court and the power of its rulings, including its fateful decision in Bush v. Gore.<br><br> <b>The Best Books of 2015 (So Far)</b>. Two years after the reappearance in print of her novels <i>Speedboat </i>and <i>Pitch Dark</i>, Adler has returned again as a reporter, essayist, and critic --- one of the best we've had on all three fronts. ... and the truth is, though she's been near-silent for some time, she only ever got better. - Christian Lorentzen, <i>New York Magazine </i>(July 23, 2015)<br> <br><b>Review</b><br> "The wonderfully funny, acute Renata Adler is almost as good an essayist as a novelist ... It doesn't mean much to say that Renata Adler's journalism isn't quite as interesting as her novels --- almost nothing is as interesting as Renata Adler's novels. ... If Adler has an heir it might be someone like the recently retired TV satirist Jon Stewart, who shares both her moral wryness and love for America. Perhaps the real loss is that nobody quite this careful is paying attention." --- Daniel Swift, <i>Spectator,</i> UK;&nbsp;<br><b>Review</b><br>" It is Adler's sort of death's-head wit that makes her such a visionary reporter -- in the Letter from Biafra, for example: "Suddenly a shrieking, giggling band of of eleven young men and three boys passed through the market, as though carried away by some enervating, mocking joke. These were some of the 'artillery cases' one sees all over Biafra, people claiming some local variety of shell shock and traveling always in packs." The "enervating, mocking joke" here -- if we listen for it --- is the failure of the UN to prevent or arrest a genocide, and beyond that the "sheer, bitterly comic ugliness of human suffering." &nbsp;"If Adler were a man ... would she be one of the boys ---celebrated and honored as a journalist-hero in the popular mind? With the electricity of her prose, I think she would. The publication of After the Tall Timber may move her closer in, or place a seal upon her exile. Either way, she'll be proved right."<i><i>--- Barnes &amp; Noble Review.</i></i><i></i><b>Review</b><i><br> </i>"Ladies and gentlemen, Renata Adler is back! It feels momentous and just plain correct that we now have After the Tall Timber, a new collection of Adler's nonfiction,<i> "--</i>Abby Aguirre,<i><i> Vogue</i></i><br> "One of the last essays in the book is, hilariously. about Bush v. Gore. Remember that? What a time in our shared heritage. ...&nbsp; I can't stop thinking about these sentences, both their meaning and their structure. Because she is so right about something we've all experienced but so rarely name. ... Last week I mentioned that I was reading the new collection of Renata Adler's essays. Now I'm going to mention it again, because the entire book is so fucking good. You have to read it. --- Haley Mlotek,<i> <i>The Hairpin</i> </i></p><p>(To follow)<b>Renata Adler </b>was born in Milan and raised in Connecticut.

Writing from the Body is not a "head book"; it is a heart book, a shoulder book, a hand book, a back book, and a soul book that liberates writers from the shackles of self-consciousness and doubt.</p><p>Developed from John Lee's popular workshops that have helped thousands of writers, this book offers meditative techniques, physical exercises, and candid counseling--all designed to combat the fears, self-imposed standards, and suppressed feelings that block creative potential. Inspirational qutoes from poems and prose develop John Lee's central message: in order to write from the truth of our total experience, we most return to our bodies.</p><p>As Lee notes, "The call to write is a call that's received in the body first. If we are to answer this call, we have to feel every part of our lives. In this book you'll learn the grammar of the gut, the syntax of the sinews, the launage of the legs. For everyone who is tired of living life in the little closet between the ears, get ready." </p><p>Any writer, artist, teacher, or psychologist interested in the creative process will find this book invaluable, a lasting source of hope and power.</p></p><p><p><b>John Lee</b> teacher Writing for Body workshops throughout the U.S. and Canada. He has taught literature at the University of Alabama, University of Texas, and Austin College before turning to lecturing, writing, and training therapists and the general public in emotional release techniques that he developed.

It promotes his Zen-like approach to writing, using exercises and meditation to free the inner voice from inhibitions and seek out one's truths. Targeting those with writer's block, Lee argues that the call to write is felt first in the body, and his exercises seek to find that call. With chapter titles such as "Loving the Inner Artist," he aims to build the writer's self-esteem. This work is more about writing as therapy than about writing technique, and it is written with a level of zeal more often found in self-help books. Though Lee's counseling insight seems genuine, the content is thin; there may have been a breakdown in translating the workshop into a book. Still, this title might cure writer's block, and it's cheaper than a therapist. It could find a home in large writing collections.<br><i>Robert C. Moore, DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Co.

Or try the buttermilk, lemon, and poppyseed pancakes she made every morning in Crete when she was pregnant&#x2014;they&#x2019;re now her little daughter Lulu&#x2019;s favorite. Warm up with a bowl of celeriac, white sweet potato, and apple soup, a dish inspired by a chilly day of horseback riding in New Zealand. You&#x2019;ll love sharing the saffron-flavored crab and watercress souffl�, a delicious homage to one of her mother&#x2019;s best-loved Christmas traditions. And since most would agree that &#x201c;a meal without dessert is like wearing only one shoe,&#x201d; try the apple, rhubarb, and strawberry nutty crumble, served with vanilla-flavored custard, just the way her husband&#x2019;s Irish grandfather preferred. <br><br>Lush styling and photography combined with sweet stories, foodie tidbits, and fresh and original recipes make <i>La Tartine Gourmande</i> perfect for those who love food and the way our lives play around it.

Her fresh, innovative recipes (all gluten free) will inspire anyone who feels daunted by the prospect of incorporating more whole grains or fresh vegetables into their diet. Highly recommended for those who&#x2019;ve mastered the basics of cooking and baking.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Library Journal </i><br>&#x201c;A lovely blend of personal reflections on cooking and food, delectable recipes, and vibrant color photographs.

How can one woman&#x2019;s life be so lovely and delicious? But this is no fairy tale&#x2014;it is B�atrice Peltre&#x2019;s glorious, enviable foodcentric reality. The book&#x2019;s subtitle couldn&#x2019;t be more apt: Every beautifully photographed recipe is indeed an inspiration, and Peltre&#x2019;s food is full of surprises. For instance, her Cranberry Upside-Down Cake unexpectedly includes saffron and olive oil, and she has ingeniously reinvented the wrap by substituting a thin omelet for flatbread. The biggest surprise, though, is the fact that this book is almost entirely gluten-free. All of her tarts, muffins, cookies, and cakes are made without wheat flour, and the results are revelatory. If you&#x2019;ve never experimented with gluten-free baking, this is the book to show you how.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Fine Cooking</i> <br><br>&#x201c;If Wikipedia had an entry for French charm, it would be defined by B�atrice Peltre.

Exactly why I fell so hard is hard to say, but it was probably some combination of the musicality of Peltre&#x2019;s French accent, the still-life artistry of her kitchen, and the innocence of her adorable sous chef Lulu.

Michael Moorcock and his long-time friend and bibliographer John Davey have collaborated to produce the most consistent and coherent narrative from the disparate novels, novellas, short stories and non-fiction about Elric. From his early life in Melnibon� all the way through to his final days, these seven volumes will be the definitive telling of the albino prince&#39;s story. Elric is one of the great creations of modern fantasy, and has inspired legions of imitators. If you know his story already, then this definitive edition will finally let you read the entire saga in the author&#39;s preferred order. If you&#39;ve never experienced the chronicles of the albino with the soul-sucking sword, then this is the perfect place to start. Containing stories, novellas, supplementary material and commentary, these editions of ELRIC are the finest yet.</p><p>Michael Moorcock (1939-) Michael Moorcock is one of the most important figures in British SF and Fantasy literature. The author of many literary novels and stories in practically every genre, his novels have won and been shortlisted for numerous awards including the Hugo, Nebula, World Fantasy, Whitbread and Guardian Fiction Prize. In 1999, he was given the World Fantasy Life Achievement Award; in 2001, he was inducted into the SF Hall of Fame; and in 2007, he was named a SFWA Grandmaster. Michael Moorcock is also a musician who has performed since the seventies with his own band, the Deep Fix; and, as a member of the prog rock band, Hawkwind, won a gold disc. His tenure as editor of New Worlds magazine in the sixties and seventies is seen as the high watermark of SF editorship in the UK, and was crucial in the development of the SF New Wave. Michael Moorcock&#39;s literary creations include Hawkmoon, Corum, Von Bek, Jerry Cornelius and, of course, his most famous character, Elric. He has been compared to, among others, Balzac, Dumas, Dickens, James Joyce, Ian Fleming, J.R.R. Tolkien and Robert E. Howard.

The Power showed up here in the 1850s because it was running from something. Now it is 1933, and the Power&#x2019;s hiding place has been discovered by a killer. <br> <br> It is a predator that eats magic and leaves destroyed worlds in its wake. Earth is next. <br> <br> Former private eye, Jake Sullivan, knows the score. The problem is hardly anyone believes him.

On the basis of years of research, interviews with dozens of the central figures, and her own personal experience, Evans explores how the political stance of these women was catalyzed and shaped by their sharp disillusionment at a time when their skills as political activists were newly and highly developed, enabling them to join forces to support their own cause.</p><p>The women most crucial to the feminist movement that emerged in the 1960&#39;s arrived at their commitment and consciousness in response to the unexpected and often shattering experience of having their work minimized, even disregarded, by the men they considered to be their colleagues and fellow crusaders in the civil rights and radical New Left movements.

Nixon had made his victory statement and was on Air Force One on his way to Key Biscayne, with H. R. (Bob) Haldeman and John Ehrlichman.<br><br>The ten weeks from election to inauguration were the most dispiriting of my years with Nixon. After his vacation at Key Biscayne, the President-�elect established his transition headquarters at the Pierre hotel, two blocks from his apartment on Fifth Avenue. The researchers and writers from the campaign were all left behind at the campaign annex known as the &#x201c;Bible Building&#x201d; at 450 Park Avenue.<br><br>A suggestion came from the President-�elect that I might want to hold off coming into the White House to write a book about his comeback, as I was the staff member who went back furthest and knew this story best. I was taken aback. I had gone to work for Richard Nixon because I had dreamed of working in his White House.<br><br>Ray Price, chief speechwriter, and I were among the first to be named special assistants to the future President on November 16. But all orders now came through Haldeman. Tanned, fit, brusque, in his early forties, Bob wore his hair in a fifties crew cut, had been an Eagle Scout, and had been Nixon&#x2019;s campaign manager against Pat Brown. He could pass for a drill sergeant at Parris Island. Yet he was not without graciousness. After I was named special assistant, Bob pulled five dollars out of his wallet and said, &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you and Shelley go down to the bar and have a couple of Bloody Marys.&#x201d;<br><br>On December 18, after hearing reports that the President-�elect was about to offer Gene McCarthy the post of ambassador to the United Nations, I wrote Nixon in protest. While it may have seemed insolent to be sending a protest note to a new President-�elect, my anger and alarm were growing. &#x201c;Here,&#x201d; I wrote of the Democratic senator who had mortally wounded LBJ in New Hampshire, then refused to endorse his fellow Minnesotan, Humphrey, until the final days of the campaign,<br><br>is an arrogant mystic with a messianic streak, who left his good friend dangling on a hook for months and perhaps cost him the election, merely because HHH caviled over a few words in a party platform. . . . If he had no loyalty to his old friend HHH, what kind of loyalty would he have to RN?<br><br>On November 20, an explosion in Farmington, West Virginia, had taken the lives of seventy-�eight miners. I wrote Nixon that we were missing one opportunity after another to &#x201c;build the majority we failed to win,&#x201d; with our 43 percent of the vote:<br><br>RN visited the UN which probably made [New York Times editorial editor] Johnny Oakes&#x2019; day, but if RN had flown to West Virginia, and without fanfare, had talked quietly with those women whose husbands had just been entombed in that mine, it would have spoken eloquently to millions of Americans whom RN and the Republican Party [have] never reached before.<br><br>Is there anyone around RN, with a little soul, thinking in terms like this?<br><br>I warned Haldeman of the problems certain to arise from the &#x201c;para-�military pyramidic structure&#x201d; he was setting up. To no avail. For what was being done by Bob was being done with the approval of the man the nation had elected. From Eisenhower days, Nixon had in mind the staff structure he wanted for his presidency. Access to the Oval Office was to be tightly controlled and restricted. Hence, Nixon denied Rose Woods, who had been with him for twenty years, the presidential secretary&#x2019;s office outside the Oval. He had Haldeman move her down the hall. To insulate himself from intrusions and keep staff conflict and advocacy at a distance, Nixon had isolated himself, an isolation that would contribute to his downfall. Yet our staff system, the House That Haldeman Built, would prove a model for future presidents. The Reagan White House where I served was a replica.<br><br>On a pre-�inauguration trip to D.C., our staff met with the outgoing White House staff of LBJ, and I went through a receiving line to shake hands with the President. Nixon stood beside Johnson as I introduced myself.<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. President, I&#x2019;m Pat Buchanan,&#x201d; I said to the man I had spent three years spearing in Nixon&#x2019;s statements and speeches. Inches taller than me, LBJ stared down, and, in an icy voice, hammering home each word, said, &#x201c;I know who you are!&#x201d; If the thirty-�sixth President meant to intimidate me, he had succeeded.<br><br>By inauguration day, the writing-�research team from the campaign had been broken into pieces, its members dispatched to disparate shops. My office was in the old Executive Office Building, on the Seventeenth Street side. And any hopes I had that this would be the conservative administration of my aspirations were fading away.<br><br>Henry Kissinger, a Harvard professor with a reputation for being a brilliant and ambitious courtier, Nelson Rockefeller&#x2019;s man, was our national security adviser. Pat Moynihan, a liberal Democrat who worked in LBJ&#x2019;s Labor Department, was counselor to the President for urban affairs. I had never met either. Both began to build large staffs loyal to themselves, little dukedoms inside President Nixon&#x2019;s White House.<br><br>Haldeman, now White House chief of staff, and Ehrlichman, counsel to the President, were seen, not altogether correctly, as interchangeable twins, ideological agnostics, and bureaucratic allies. Both had been advance men in 1960, and both began to build staffs, with Haldeman&#x2019;s men controlling access to the Oval Office. Ehrlichman was a Seattle lawyer and Haldeman an ad executive with J. Walter Thompson. Both were Christian Scientists, friends since college at UCLA, but strangers to me when they arrived in mid-�1968. Journalists called them &#x201c;the Berlin Wall.&#x201d; To some veterans of 1966 and 1968, these late arrivals, given their Prussian aspect, were simply &#x201c;the Germans.&#x201d; In Pat Nixon: The Untold Story, a loving memoir of her mother, Julie Nixon Eisenhower points to May 28, 1968, as the day the music died:<br><br>The night of the Oregon primary victory, Bob Haldeman joined the Nixon staff and rapidly the hectic but intimate atmosphere of the primaries acquired a businesslike, no-�nonsense tempo. Hobart Lewis, a personal friend of the family who traveled with the Nixon campaign whenever he could squeeze time from his job as an executive editor of the Reader&#x2019;s Digest, spent three days with the staff shortly after Haldeman became chief of staff. Once home, he brooded for forty-�eight hours before finally telephoning Rose Woods to ask bluntly, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s happened? The fun&#x2019;s gone.&#x201d;<br><br>The conservative staffers who had played major roles in Nixon&#x2019;s comeback were scattered. Alan Greenspan, our research chief, got no offer that appealed to him. Dick Allen, foreign policy chief in the campaign, was named deputy to Henry Kissinger, who exiled him to the Executive Office Building, or EOB. He would resign by year&#x2019;s end. Martin Anderson, who had headed up domestic policy research, became the top aide to the other counselor, Dr. Arthur Burns. But Burns lacked the presidential access of Moynihan and by year&#x2019;s end was on his way to the Federal Reserve. Marty would soon depart. The shop where conservatism was not seen as a suspect cult was the legislative liaison staff of Bryce Harlow, who had held the same White House post under Ike. Tom Huston, Bill Gavin, and I, conservatives all, were sent to speechwriting, to be balanced by liberals Bill Safire, Ray Price, and Lee Huebner, a former head of the Ripon Society. Speechwriting was headed by Jim Keogh of Time magazine, a Nixon biographer, moderate Republican, and genuinely nice man. Bill Gavin would recollect in his memoir Speechwright:<br><br>At least once a week . . . the writing staff, headed by Jim Keogh, would meet in his large office at the end of the first-�floor EOB hallway. After getting assignments from Jim, we would . . . commiserate with each other, because under the new organizational system imposed by H. R. Haldeman, the previous close, informal relationship between Nixon and his writers had been replaced by a technically more efficient&#x2014;�but, in my view, ultimately less satisfying&#x2014;�process. What we made up in flow-�chart organization we lost in human contact.<br><br>On the campaign trail the writers could be called to the front cabin of Tricia [Nixon&#x2019;s plane] at any time.<br><br>Before the inauguration, I was told by Haldeman that the President wanted me to set up a special news summary and have it on his desk at 7 a.m. I was also to prepare his briefing books, predicting the questions the President would be asked, and writing the answers he should give, for all press conferences. I was to attend all congressional leadership meetings and write up for the President&#x2019;s files what was said and decided. And I was to handle speechwriting assignments that would be coming through Jim Keogh.<br><br>Though I had only just turned thirty, I came into the White House with advantages over many of my colleagues. The first was a personal friendship with the President, at whose side only Rose and I had been for all three years of his comeback. We had been through many battles together. I had been a confidant with whom he could share drinks, speak in candor, and trade jokes. I was a friend of the First Lady, with whom I had worked in that closet of an office outside his at Nixon, Mudge. My future wife, Shelley, had long personal ties to the First Family, having worked for Vice President Nixon a year out of college, traveled with him in the 1960 campaign and in the Goldwater campaign, then rejoined him in January 1967. After the West Wing was remodeled at Nixon&#x2019;s direction, Shelley would become the receptionist to the President and all White House aides in the West Wing.<br><br>Crucially, I had been given by the good Lord a gift, developed in three years of editorial writing and three years of working intimately with Nixon. I could write swiftly, tersely, wittily, and well memos that Nixon loved to read, on matters he cared about most: politics, policy, and personalities. As this book reveals, Nixon asked for and welcomed my missives. It became our primary means of conversation. Over the Nixon White House years, I would send him a thousand. Lastly, Nixon knew I was the most reliable representative in his White House of the conservative wing of his party and his coalition, allies whom he often viewed with skepticism and suspicion. Within weeks of the inauguration, my channel to the Oval Office and the Mansion, via phone calls day and night and memos crossing and recrossing West Executive Avenue, had been reestablished. I had broken through the wall.<br><br>In an early column, the White House correspondent for The New Republic, John Osborne, a keen observer of palace politics, wrote of the loss of proximity and access to the President of the writers who had helped shape the campaign and develop the issues that had won Nixon the election. Singling out my assignment to set up a news summary, Osborne wrote:<br><br>Pat Buchanan&#x2019;s considerable talents would seem to be wasted on such a chore. . . . Buchanan . . . and other veterans of the staff rank third in the pecking order of &#x201c;assistants,&#x201d; &#x201c;deputy assistants,&#x201d; &#x201c;special assistants,&#x201d; and staff assistants to the President. The theory is that they will contribute to the evolution of policy in their assigned fields, but one gets the impression around the White House that they find themselves farther from the President and less involved in the policy process than they had hoped to be.<br><br>Osborne had understated the demotion. Counselors to the President held Cabinet rank, while the Special Assistant title had been depreciated by inflating the number and creating three titles above it. Three dozen aides, some of whom I had never met, had titles as high as or higher than mine. Yet, as Osborne was writing this in his column, my relationship with the President, whom younger aides began to call &#x201c;the Old Man,&#x201d; was being restored.</p><h2>Murder in the Latin Quarter (Aimee Leduc Investigations, No. 9)</h2><p><b>The ninth Aim�e Leduc investigation set in Paris</b><br><br>A Haitian woman arrives at the office of Leduc Detective proclaiming that she is Aim�e Leduc&#x2019;s sister, her father&#x2019;s illegitimate daughter.

But this whip-smart, highly readable book&#x2019;s scope turns out to be much broader. Worried about the monopolistic tendencies of big tech? The addictive apps on your iPhone?

How long ago that feels. Of course, it would be unfair to accuse Google of being actively evil. But evil is as evil does, and some of the things that Google and other Big Tech firms have done in recent years have not been very nice.<br><br>When Larry Page and Sergey Brin first dreamed up the idea for Google as Stanford graduate students, they probably didn&#x2019;t imagine that the shiny apple of knowledge that was their search engine would ever get anyone expelled from paradise (as many Google executives have been over a variety of scandals in recent years). Nor could they have predicted the many embarrassments that would emanate from the Googleplex: Google doctoring its algorithms in ways that would deep-six rivals off the crucial first page of its search results. Google&#x2019;s YouTube hosting instructional videos on how to build a bomb. Google selling ads to Russian agents, granting them use of the platform to spread misinformation and manipulate the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Google working on a potential search engine for China&#x2014;one that would be compliant with the regime&#x2019;s efforts to censor unwelcome results. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt leaving his position as executive chairman of Google&#x2019;s parent company, Alphabet, a few months after the New York Times revealed he&#x2019;d been unduly influencing antitrust policy work at a think tank that both his family foundation and Google itself supported, going so far as to push for the firing of a policy analyst who dared to speculate about whether Google might be engaging in anticompetitive practices (something that Schmidt has denied). In May 2019, Schmidt announced he would be stepping down from the Alphabet board as well.<br><br>All of this may not exactly be evil, but it certainly is worrisome.<br><br>Google&#x2019;s true sin, like that of many Silicon Valley behemoths, may simply be hubris. The company&#x2019;s top brass always wanted it to be big enough to set its own rules, and that has been its downfall, just as it has been for so many Big Tech firms. But this is not a book about Google alone. It is a book about how today&#x2019;s most powerful companies are bifurcating our economy, corrupting our political process, and fogging our minds. While Google will often stand as the poster child for the industry more generally, this book will also cover the other four FAANGs&#x2014;Facebook, Apple, Amazon, and Netflix&#x2014;as well as a number of additional platform giants, like Uber, that have come to dominate their respective spaces in the technology industry. I&#x2019;ll also touch on the ways that a variety of older companies, from IBM to GM, are evolving in response to these new challengers. And I will look at the rise of a new generation of Chinese tech giants that is going where even the FAANGs don&#x2019;t dare.<br><br>While there are plenty of companies both in Silicon Valley and elsewhere that illustrate the upsides and the downsides of digital transformation, the big technology platform firms have been the chief beneficiaries of the epic digital transformation we&#x2019;re undergoing. They have replaced the industrialism of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries with the information-based economy that has come to define the twenty-first.<br><br>The implications are myriad, and I will track many of them, often via the Google narrative, which has been the marker for larger industry-wide shifts. Google has, after all, been the pioneer of big data, targeted advertising, and the type of surveillance capitalism that this book will cover. It was following the &#x201c;move fast and break things&#x201d; ethos long before Facebook.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve been following the company for over twenty years, and I first encountered the celebrated Google founders, Page and Brin, not in the Valley, but in Davos, the Swiss gathering spot of the global power elite, where they&#x2019;d taken over a small chalet to meet with a select group of media. The year was 2007. The company had just purchased YouTube a few months back, and it seemed eager to convince skeptical journalists that this acquisition wasn&#x2019;t yet another death blow to copyright, paid content creation, and the viability of the news publications for which we worked.<br><br>Unlike the buttoned-up consulting types from McKinsey and BCG, or the suited executives from the old guard multinational corporations that roamed the promenades of Davos, their tasseled loafers slipping on the icy paths, the Googlers were the cool bunch. They wore fashionable sneakers, and their chalet was sleek, white, and stark, with giant cubes masquerading as chairs in a space that looked as though it had been repurposed that morning by designers flown in from the Valley. In fact, it may have been, and if so, Google wouldn&#x2019;t have been alone in such excess. I remember attending a party once in Davos, hosted by Napster founder and former Facebook president Sean Parker, that featured giant taxidermy bears and a musical performance by John Legend.<br><br>Back in the Google chalet, Brin and Page projected a youthful earnestness as they explained the company&#x2019;s involvement in authoritarian China, and insisted they&#x2019;d never be like Microsoft, which was considered the corporate bully and monopolist of the time. What about the future of news, we wanted to know. After admitting that Page read only free news online whereas Brin often bought the Sunday New York Times in print (&#x201c;It&#x2019;s nice!&#x201d; he said, cheerfully), the duo affirmed exactly what we journalists wanted to hear: Google, they assured us, would never threaten our livelihoods. Yes, advertisers were indeed migrating en masse from our publications to the Web, where they could target consumers with a level of precision that the print world could barely imagine. But not to worry. Google would generously retool our business model so we, too, could thrive in the new digital world.<br><br>I was much younger then, and not yet the (admittedly) cynical business journalist that I have become, and yet I still listened to that happy &#x201c;future of news&#x201d; lecture with some skepticism. Whether Google actually intended to develop some brilliant new revenue model or not, what alarmed me was that none of us were asking a far more important question. Sitting toward the back of the room, somewhat conscious of my relatively junior status, I hesitated, waiting until the final moments of the meeting before raising my hand.<br><br>&#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re talking about all this like journalism is the only thing that matters, but isn&#x2019;t this really about . . . democracy?&#x201d; If newspapers and magazines are all driven out of business by Google or companies like it, I asked, how are people going to find out what&#x2019;s going on?<br><br>Larry Page looked at me with an odd expression, as if he was surprised that someone should be asking such a na�ve question. &#x201c;Oh, yes. We&#x2019;ve got a lot of people thinking about that.&#x201d;<br><br>Not to worry, his tone seemed to say. Google had the engineers working on that &#x201c;democracy&#x201d; problem. Next question?<br><br>Well, it turns out that we did have to worry about democracy, and since November 2016, we have had to worry about it a lot more. And it&#x2019;s impossible to ignore the obvious: As tech firms have become inexorably more powerful, our democracy has become more precarious. Newspapers and magazines have been hollowed out by Google and Facebook, which in 2018 together took 60 percent of the Internet advertising market. This is a key reason for the shuttering of some 1,800 newspapers between 2004 and 2018, a process that has left 200 counties with no paper at all, restricting the supply of reliable information that is the oxygen of democracy. And given that digital advertising surpassed TV ads in 2017, it&#x2019;s clear that TV news will be the next to go. While cable news may have gotten a &#x201c;Trump bump&#x201d; in recent years, the longer term trend line is clear&#x2014;TV will ultimately be disintermediated by Big Tech just the way print media has been.<br><br>But the trouble with Big Tech isn&#x2019;t just an economic and business issue; it has political and cognitive implications as well. Often, these trends are written about in isolation, but in fact they are deeply intertwined. In this book, my goal is to connect the dots&#x2014;to tell the whole story, which is far bigger than the sum of its parts.</p><h2>350+ Knitting Tips, Techniques, and Trade Secrets: How to Be Better at What You Do (Knit &amp; Crochet)</h2><p><p><b>Betty Barnden's updated edition of <i>350+ Knitting Tips, Techniques, and Trade Secrets</i> is a perfect gift for creative crafters. </b></p><p>Give a stylish finish to your knitted garments and accessories with this essential compendium of knitting know-how.

In this volume his finest writings on modern society make their long-awaited appearance in English.</p><p>This book is a celebration of the masses&#x2015;their tastes, amusements, and everyday lives. Taking up themes of modernity, such as isolation and alienation, urban culture, and the relation between the group and the individual, Kracauer explores a kaleidoscope of topics: shopping arcades, the cinema, bestsellers and their readers, photography, dance, hotel lobbies, Kafka, the Bible, and boredom. For Kracauer, the most revelatory facets of modern life in the West lie on the surface, in the ephemeral and the marginal. Of special fascination to him is the United States, where he eventually settled after fleeing Germany and whose culture he sees as defined almost exclusively by &#x201c;the ostentatious display of surface.&#x201d;</p><p>With these essays, written in the 1920s and early 1930s and edited by the author in 1963, Kracauer was the first to demonstrate that studying the everyday world of the masses can bring great rewards. <i>The Mass Ornament</i> today remains a refreshing tribute to popular culture, and its impressively interdisciplinary essays continue to shed light not only on Kracauer&#x2019;s later work but also on the ideas of the Frankfurt School, the genealogy of film theory and cultural studies, Weimar cultural politics, and, not least, the exigencies of intellectual exile.</p><p>In his introduction, Thomas Levin situates Kracauer in a turbulent age, illuminates the forces that influenced him&#x2015;including his friendships with Walter Benjamin, Theodor Adorno, and other Weimar intellectuals&#x2015;and provides the context necessary for understanding his ideas. Until now, Kracauer has been known primarily for his writings on the cinema. This volume brings us the full scope of his gifts as one of the most wide-ranging and penetrating interpreters of modern life.</p></p><p><p>Siegfried Kracauer (1889&#x2013;1966) was the author of <i>Theory of Film</i>, <i>From Caligari to Hitler</i>, and many other works on historical, sociological, and cultural topics.</p><p>Thomas Y.

Rabbi Trepp provides a masterful overview of Judaism that is at once historical and personal.</p><p>The first of the book's two parts, "Torah and History," provides historical insight and perspective. It takes the reader from biblical origins through post-biblical history and on to the development of the main branches of world Jewry. It presents as well the dynamics of American Jewry, the Holocaust, and the rebirth of Israel.</p><p>In the second part of the book, "Torah, Mitzvot, and Jewish Thought," Rabbi Trepp presents the personal aspects of Judaism and Jewish life. He explores the many diverse and rich approaches to contemporary religious study, worship, and community service. These chapters examine the celebration of holidays and the observance of life-cycle events. Rabbi Trepp also includes chapters on Jewish mysticism, philosophy, and the scholarly study of Jewish texts.</p><p>Eight maps and 140 illustrations enhance Rabbi Trepp's vivid and lively dialogue.</p><p></p><p>Long regarded as the most comprehensive one-volume history of Jewish civilization,�&#x2020;<em>A History of the Jewish Experience</em>�&#x2020;is now more valuable than ever--an essential part of every Jewish library or home collection.</p><p>Ideal for adult study, college courses, and post-confirmation and high school classes.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Flawless Mirror</h2><p>In this book Kamala Silva tells the deeply moving story of how she met her Guru, and how Yogananda transformed her life&#x2015;carefully guiding and nurturing his young disciple, directing her steps toward God, until she had grown greatly on the path of Self-realization. Included in this volume are many letters Yogananda had written to Kamala, early poems that later were published in Whispers from Eternity, and the story of how Yogananda was first inspired to create a new scripture: his revelatory commentaries on the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. Kamala also relates some of the uplifting spiritual experiences she had received through the agency of her great Guru. For those who have wondered what it would have been like to know Yogananda, and how the Master would have acted in personal moments and great occasions alike, The Flawless Mirror offers rare insights.</p><p>As a teenager, Kamala Silva met and attended lectures given by the great spiritual master and world teacher, Paramhansa Yogananda. For twenty-seven years Kamala continued her close association with her Guru, receiving a great deal of personal instruction, serving often in Yogananda&#39;s headquarters, and eventually becoming a minister of Self-Realization Fellowship, the organization Yogananda founded. Later on, with her husband Edward, Kamala founded an SRF temple in Richmond, California, in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><h2>The Shambhala Anthology of Women&#39;s Spiritual Poetry</h2><p><i>The Shambhala Anthology of Women's Spiritual Poetry </i> celebrates the unique spiritual life of women through a rich selection of poetry written over the past four thousand years, from thirty-six different languages and cultures. It ranges from verse by the first recorded poet, a Sumerian priestess named Enheduanna (circa 2,300 BCE), to Anne Sexton; from early Buddhist nuns to Emily Dickinson; from Hildegard of Bingen to Tess Gallagher. Many of the translations are from distinguished authors and poets, such as Coleman Barks, Samuel Beckett, Stanley Kunitz, W. S. Merwin, Kenneth Rexroth, Arthur Waley, and Richard Wilbur. <br><br>In this book (originally published as <i>Voices of Light), </i> the spiritual impulse is expressed broadly as a visionary quest toward self-realization, as well as the desire for union with God, with the source of divine light, with a mystic lover, or with the source of nature. Many of the poets here also remind us that the spiritual is within everyone and unites us through empathy with the suffering and joy of others&#x2014;a poetry of witness. <br><br> <i>Contributors include: </i>Anne Bradstreet, Sappho, Sylvia Plath, Hildegard of Bingen, Yosano Akiko, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Tess Gallagher, Anne Sexton, Beatrice of Nazareth, Carolyn Forch�, Mary: Mother of Jesus, Denise Levertov, Emily Dickinson, H.D., Linda Hogan, Charlotte Bront�, Louise Erdrich, Lucille Clifton, Anna Akhmatova, Marianne Moore, Mechthild of Magdeburg, Praxilla, Sor Juana In�s de la Cruz, and many others.</p><p>Aliki Barnstone's most recent books are <i>Wild With It </i>(Sheep Meadow Press, 2002) and <i>Madly in Love </i> (Carnegie Mellon University Press, 1997).

A call for freshness, spontaneity and life in worship has been resounding through the churches of the English-speaking world, together with a desire to hear God speaking here and now to his people. Many have called for a return to the pattern of worship found in 1 Corinthians 14, merging the biblical emphasis of the Reformation with the vitality of the modern Pentecostal and Charismatic movements. Dr O. Palmer Robertson, pastor and Seminary teacher, currently Director of African Bible College, Uganda, argues from Scripture that preoccupation with tongues and prophecy shows a failure to grasp the fullness of New Testament privileges. The Christ of the Scriptures is the Final Word. All the church will ever need is to be found in him.</p><p></p><h2>Landscape in Sunlight</h2><p><p><i>At the end of the war, Mrs. Midge stayed on.

Now the beloved author returns with a collection of bracing poems as visceral and deeply felt and hilarious as her memoirs. In <em>Tropic of Squalor</em>, Karr dares to address the numinous&#x2014;that mystery some of us hope towards in secret, or maybe dare to pray to. The "squalor" of meaninglessness that every thoughtful person wrestles with sits at the core of human suffering, and Karr renders it with power&#x2014;illness, death, love&#x2019;s agonized disappointments. Her brazen verse calls us out of our psychic swamplands and into that hard-won awareness of the divine hiding in the small moments that make us human. In a single poem she can generate tears, horror, empathy, laughter, and peace. She never preaches. But whether you&#x2019;re an adamant atheist, a pilgrim, or skeptically curious, these poems will urge you to find an inner light in the most baffling hours of darkness.</p></p><p><p>Mary Karr is the author of three award-winning, bestselling memoirs: <em>The Liars&#x2019; Club</em>, <em>Cherry</em>, and <em>Lit</em>, as well as <em>The Art of Memoir</em>, also a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller.

He is the author of six books of poems, an acclaimed memoir The Meadow, and a novel.Galvin's poetry has always been quirky perceptions, statements made or pronouncements uttered, then clarified through a non-sequitur hodgepodge of oddly turned phrases. His poetry is one of thesis, then evidence to round out his theses, a strategy that works only in every other poem. The reader breaks through, perhaps even relishes, "The industry of flowers/Is dying young," or "The pier is less like a bridge than a well,/Since it leads to water." The reader also cheers his "Indirective," a take-off of Robert Frost's "Directive," or the unadorned "Old Men on the Courthouse Lawn, Murray, Kentucky," the title itself directing the poet to be clear. On the whole, however, Galvin's dazzling invention confuses, rather than enlightens, and his audience dwindles halfway through twenty-plus years of writing. While we laud him for intellect or poetic ambition, we also scratch our heads to such visions as: "Wherewithal, arrested moments,/ The throes of demysitification, /Morality as nothing more/Than humility and honesty, a salty measure." -- <i>From Independent Publisher</i></p><h2>Chemistry Made Simple: A Complete Introduction to the Basic Building Blocks of Matter</h2><p>See the world, one molecule at a time. <br><br>Chemistry helps us understand not only the world around us, but also our own bodies.

It offers an incisive portrait of Thomas Jefferson set against a social fabric of planters in decline, enslaved black families torn apart by sales, and a hair-trigger code of male honor. A man of &#x201c;deft evasions&#x201d; who was both courtly and withdrawn, Jefferson sought control of his family and state from his lofty perch at Monticello. Never quite the egalitarian we wish him to be, he advocated emancipation but shrank from implementing it, entrusting that reform to the next generation. Devoted to the education of his granddaughters, he nevertheless accepted their subordination in a masculine culture. During the revolution, he proposed to educate all white children in Virginia, but later in life he narrowed his goal to building an elite university.</p><p>In 1819 Jefferson&#x2019;s intensive drive for state support of a new university succeeded. His intention was a university to educate the sons of Virginia&#x2019;s wealthy planters, lawyers, and merchants, who might then democratize the state and in time rid it of slavery. But the university&#x2019;s students, having absorbed the traditional vices of the Virginia gentry, preferred to practice and defend them. Opening in 1825, the university nearly collapsed as unruly students abused one another, the enslaved servants, and the faculty. Jefferson&#x2019;s hopes of developing an enlightened leadership for the state were disappointed, and Virginia hardened its commitment to slavery in the coming years. The university was born with the flaws of a slave society. Instead, it was Jefferson&#x2019;s beloved granddaughters who carried forward his faith in education by becoming dedicated teachers of a new generation of women.</p> 23 illustrations</p><p><strong>Alan Taylor</strong> is Thomas Jefferson Foundation Professor of History at University of Virginia.

What was supposed to be a quiet outpost, far from the blazing conflict between the Star Kingdom of Manticore and the People's Republic of Haven has actually been targeted by an unholy alliance between the slaveholders of Manpower, the rival star kingdoms of Mesa and Monica, and the bureaucrats of the Solarian League. The alliance stands to benefit if the Havenites defeat Manticore, and are preparing for a surprise attack from the rear to divide Manticore's forces, which are already strained nearly to their limits. With their captain, the young Manticoran officers will risk their careers, if not their lives, on an unauthorized mission to expose and counter the threat to their Star Kingdom. Follow their journey as they show what they're made of as <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author David Weber begins a new series that will be a must for the hundreds of thousands of Honor Harrington fans.</p><p>David Weber is a science fiction phenomenon. His popular Honor Harrington space-opera adventures are &#34;New York Times&#34; bestsellers and can&#39;t come out fast enough for his devoted readers. Weber and his wife Sharon live in South Carolina.In his long-running saga of the Manticoran Space Navy and its battles (<i>War of Honor</i>, etc.), Weber has chronicled the career of Honor Harrington, a distaff Horatio Hornblower transplanted into a futuristic conflict based loosely on the Napoleonic wars. These hugely entertaining and clever adventures are the very epitome of space opera, but their emphasis on one officer's contribution tends to give a lopsided view of how a military organization fights. In his rousing second Honorverse novel (after 2003's <i>Crown of Slaves</i>, coauthored with Eric Flint), Weber focuses on how each member of a unit contributes to the mission's success through teamwork, discipline and individual initiative. A scratch task force is dispatched to a series of fringe systems that have petitioned to join the Manticoran Space Nation. What is supposed to be a relatively easy assignment to a sector far from the front lines of the renewed Havenite War is soon complicated both by terrorists who oppose the annexation and by corrupt elements of the Solarian League&#x2014;the major power in Weber's universe&#x2014;who don't want the stiff-necked Manties sniffing around their highly illegal (and lucrative) genetic slave trade. Weber emphasizes the role that tradition plays in inspiring our lads and lasses in uniform, reminding the reader that a hero can be anyone who does his or her job with honor, commitment and skill. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His writings were edited by his disciple Porphyry, who published them many years after his master's death in six sets of nine treatises each (the Enneads).</p><p>Plotinus regarded Plato as his master, and his own philosophy is a profoundly original development of the Platonism of the first two centuries of the Christian era and the closely related thought of the Neopythagoreans, with some influences from Aristotle and his followers and the Stoics, whose writings he knew well but used critically. He is a unique combination of mystic and Hellenic rationalist. His thought dominated later Greek philosophy and influenced both Christians and Moslems, and is still alive today because of its union of rationality and intense religious experience.</p><p>In his acclaimed edition of Plotinus, Armstrong provides excellent introductions to each treatise.

Carlo alle Quattro Fontane is coming to seem unduly simplistic. In this carefully researched and original study, Andrew Hopkins examines the century&#39;s changing functional demands, the political forces, the patronage system, and local traditions. Exploring a wide range of Italian buildings (including those outside the major urban centers), he introduces us to dozens of neglected architects whose works will come as a revelation. By 1630, architecture had taken on a new dynamism that would soon conquer Italy, Europe, and the New World: the baroque. 209 b/w illustrations.</p><p><b>Andrew Hopkins</b> is the editor of <i>The Burlington Magazine</i> and a renowned authority on Italian architecture.</p><h2>Renaissance Art: A Beginner&#39;s Guide (Beginner&#39;s Guides)</h2><p>The 15th century saw the evolution of a distinct and powerfully influential European culture.

Of unknown age and provenance, Freddie is a skirt-swathed enigma&#x2014;a woman who by sheer force of character and single-minded thrust has turned herself and her school into a national institution. Anyone who is anyone must know Freddie.<br><br>Filled with unique and hilarious insights into the theatrical world, <i>At Freddie&#x2019;s</i> is a beguiling story for those of us who sometimes pretend to be something we are not.<br><br>&#x201c;Love, fear, class, ambition, even death&#x2014;it's all in here, but so elegantly presented that you've finished your plate before you even think to ask about the ingredients.&#x201d; &#x2014;National Public Radio</p><p>Age has indeed withered the proprietress of London's Temple School for child actors, but custom has yet to stale her infinite, cadging variety. Freddie--born Frieda Wentworth--is Penelope Fitzgerald's most marvelous sacred monster, a woman insanely devoted to her art. Over several decades she has foiled debt collectors, creditors, and bailiffs at every turn. What matter if Freddie's Covent Garden redoubt is freezing and falling apart, her own office-cum-bedroom a haven for must and dust, mold and mothballs? When one would-be financier has the temerity to display a balance sheet, she orders him to put it away, "in the tone she used to the local flasher." After all, this force of theatrical nature can always rely on actors and theaters for desperate, last-minute donations. On the other hand, it <i>is</i> 1963, and the school is threatened by others specializing in film and TV training, but so far Freddie is sticking to her Shakespearean guns.<p> The Temple's permanent staff consists of an unskilled handyman and Freddie's assistant and dresser, the possibly malevolent Miss Blewett. Its acting coaches include a man who's made his career out of understudying Nana, the dog-nurse in <i>Peter Pan</i>. Needless to say, the students are not impressed. To further trim expenses, Freddie has hired two new teachers from Northern Ireland. One, Hannah Graves, is qualified; the other, Pierce Carroll, decidedly not--but Freddie hires him for other reasons: "She had heard in his remarks the weak, but pure, voice of complete honesty. She was not sure that she had ever heard it before, and thought it would be worth studying as a curiosity." These two innocents are in academic charge of the young thespians, an egomaniacal, mostly mendacious lot. (In a stage school, after all, insincerity is a good thing.) But Freddie's does house one genius: 9-year-old, unknowable Jonathan Kemp. Even his guinea pig inherits his bad luck, and is soon devoured by one of the theater district's roving felines. Jonathan seems destined to be overshadowed by Mattie Stewart (later Stewart Matthews), a showoff who at least has the grace--even if it is manifested in spurts of violence--to know himself inferior. Meanwhile, we watch Pierce fall in love, hopelessly, with his colleague. Alas, he hasn't a chance against the dissipated actor Boney Lewis, though Hannah tries not to destroy him: "At the corner, she gave him a hug and a kiss, as one does to a cousin, or to the inconsolable." </p><p> <i>At Freddie's</i>, Penelope Fitzgerald's 1982 parable of the talents, constantly shifts between such despair and high comedy. Many Fitzgerald-philes feel that she reached her apex in her three European novels--<i>Innocence</i>, <i>The Beginning of Spring</i>, and <i>The Blue Flower</i>. In fact, she had already arrived there with this perfect novel of ideas, ideals, and oddities. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>PENELOPE FITZGERALD wrote many books small in size but enormous in popular and critical acclaim over the past two decades. Over 300,000 copies of her novels are in print, and profiles of her life appeared in both The <i>New Yorker</i> and The <i>New York Times Magazine</i>. In 1979, her novel <i>Offshore </i>won Britain's Booker Prize, and in 1998 she won the National Book Critics Circle Prize for <i>The Blue Flower</i>. Though Fitzgerald embarked on her literary career when she was in her 60's, her career was praised as "the best argument ...&nbsp;for a publishing debut made late in life" (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>). She told the <i>New York Times</i> Magazine, "In all that time, I could have written books and I didn&#x2019;t. I think you can write at any time of your life." Dinitia Smith, in her <i>New York Times</i> Obituary of May 3, 2000, quoted Penelope Fitzgerald from 1998 as saying, "I have remained true to my deepest convictions, I mean to the courage of those who are born to be defeated, the weaknesses of the strong, and the tragedy of misunderstandings and missed opportunities, which I have done my best to treat as comedy, for otherwise how can we manage to bear it?"</p><h2>Scrimshaw Techniques (Schiffer Books)</h2><p>This guide is a dazzling showcase of this uniquely American art form.

During the 1960s and '70s, Polaroid was the coolest technology company on earth. Like Apple, it was an innovation machine that cranked out one must-have product after another. Led by its own visionary genius founder, Edwin Land, Polaroid grew from a 1937 garage start-up into a billion-dollar pop-culture phenomenon. <em>Instant</em> tells the remarkable tale of Land's one-of-a-kind invention-from Polaroid's first instant camera to hit the market in 1948, to its meteoric rise in popularity and adoption by artists such as Ansel Adams, Andy Warhol, and Chuck Close, to the company's dramatic decline into bankruptcy in the late '90s and its unlikely resurrection in the digital age. Instant is both an inspiring tale of American ingenuity and a cautionary business tale about the perils of companies that lose their creative edge.</p><p><i><b>INSTANT: THE STORY OF POLAROID</b></i> is a book about a very unusual company. In the 1960s and 1970s, Polaroid was what Apple is today: the coolest technology company on earth, the one with irresistible products, the one whose stock kept climbing way past the point of logic. In its heyday, Polaroid was an absolute innovation machine--a scientific think tank that periodically kicked out a fantastically profitable, covetable product. In fact, the late Steve Jobs expressly said that he modeled his company to a great extent after Polaroid.<br><br><i>Instant</i> is a business story, about what happens when a company loses its innovative spark. It is a fine-arts story, showcasing the amazing things photographers (from Ansel Adams to Andy Warhol to Chuck Close) did with Polaroid film. It is a technology story, of a company that created and maintained a niche all its own for 60 years. And it is a pop-culture history, of a friendly product that millions of people absolutely adored. I like to think that it also tells a larger story, about the rise and fall of American invention and manufacturing.<blockquote>"Edwin Land was one of Steve Jobs's first heroes, and this book shows why. He created a startup in a garage that grew into a company that stood at the intersection of creativity and technology.

I&#x2019;m Opal. I spoke with you yesterday.&#x201d; She adjusted her trifocals and with an open palm patted the side of her poofed-up white hair.<br><br>Kellie gave me a what-is-going-on-here look. All I could do was shrug.<br><br>&#x201c;As I indicated on the phone,&#x201d; Opal continued, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fully prepared to pay your regular fees. My only question is, when might you be able to provide me with an estimate?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; Kellie said in a tone that revealed her instinctively smooth and professional demeanor. &#x201c;I think you might have me confused with someone else.&#x201d;<br><br>Opal blinked. &#x201c;Are you not an interior designer?&#x201d;<br><br>The truthful answer for Kellie was yes. She was, as a hobby, an interior designer. &#x201c;Who were you expecting to meet?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>Flustered, Opal reached for her pocketbook, undid the clasp, and rummaged around. Instead of a note or a business card, she extracted a handkerchief and held it in her left hand as if for moral support. &#x201c;I have the name here somewhere.&#x201d; She looked at Kellie again. &#x201c;Are you certain you are not a designer? I thought I recognized you from Sunshine Manor.&#x201d;<br><br>Kellie smiled. &#x201c;My aunt used to live at Sunshine Manor. Did you know Martha Wojckski?&#x201d;<br><br>Opal&#x2019;s expression lifted. &#x201c;Yes, of course I knew Martha. Her apartment was beautifully decorated. Which is exactly why I&#x2019;m meeting with a designer. I&#x2019;m afraid I&#x2019;ll go mad if I don&#x2019;t have a change of color on the walls soon. Do you happen to know who designed your aunt&#x2019;s apartment?&#x201d;<br><br>Kellie blushed. &#x201c;Actually, I did.&#x201d;<br><br>Opal sat up straight. &#x201c;Then I should like to engage you for the work needed on my apartment.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a professional interior designer,&#x201d; Kellie said quickly. She looked to me for backup, but I didn&#x2019;t agree. Kellie had done wonders with my small home, and her home was a masterpiece. She had wanted to pursue designing for well over a decade but had never taken the first step toward that dream. If Opal was going to push Kellie off the cliff by inviting her to take this risk, I wasn&#x2019;t going to stop her.<br><br>&#x201c;You did such a lovely job with your aunt&#x2019;s apartment. If you&#x2019;re available, I would certainly like to hire you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What about the other designer you were going to meet here?&#x201d; Kellie asked.<br><br>Opal looked around and glanced at her watch. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think she&#x2019;s coming. We only had a tentative meeting arranged, which is why I was so hopeful when I saw you wave. In her message yesterday she said she was reluctant to take on the project since I live at Sunshine Manor. Apparently there are difficulties in working within the limitations set by the association.&#x201d;<br><br>While Opal was talking, I had been giving Kellie all the nonverbals I thought she needed to recognize this as a golden opportunity she had better snatch. Kellie may have had one eye on my affirming expressions, but she definitely had both ears open to Opal.<br><br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Kellie said to Opal. &#x201c;They do have some strict rules. I found a way to work around some of the restrictions. They aren&#x2019;t that complicated. We just have to file the necessary forms.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Does this mean you&#x2019;ll come to give me an estimate?&#x201d; <br><br>Kellie swallowed.<br><br>I gave her my most encouraging smile. <br><br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; Kellie said with a hesitant sort of nod. &#x201c;Sure. Why not? When would you like me to come?&#x201d;<br><br>The next afternoon I accompanied Kellie to Opal&#x2019;s apartment. My presence was partly for support and partly because I was fascinated by Opal. Her accent reminded me of Mrs. Roberts, a woman who had been important to me during high school.<br><br>Sunshine Manor was all of two blocks from Brew-La-La. We found number 2017 and knocked. Opal opened the door, and I offered one of my best smiles to Kellie&#x2019;s first unofficial client. I don&#x2019;t have a lot of stunning attributes like Kellie with her gorgeous, thick auburn hair and her warm, perceptive eyes. My hair is flyaway and fair like my skin. But I do know how to smile. I can almost always get others, even pouting children, to smile back when I give them a generous grin.<br><br>Opal invited us inside. &#x201c;May I offer you some tea?&#x201d;<br><br>Kellie and I slid into straight-backed chairs at a round table in the corner. A pudgy, rose-strewn china teapot and a plate of gingersnaps awaited us. We sipped Earl Grey from china teacups balanced on saucers, and I felt like we were little girls playing dress-up. This was a stretch for us. Kellie and I were decaf-grandetriple-nonfat-latte-in-a-to-go-cup kind of women.<br><br>I tried out what I hoped was proper British tea-party conversation.&#x201c;Have you lived here long, Opal?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not long. Sixteen years. My husband lived in Orlando as a child. He was determined to return and spend his final days in the sunshine. He did exactly that. I&#x2019;ve been alone the past eight years.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where did you live before coming here?&#x201d; Kellie asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I lived nearly all my life in a small town in England called Olney.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I always wanted to go to England.&#x201d; I sat up a bit straighter. &#x201c;Especially London.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is that so?&#x201d;<br><br>I nodded with the same eagerness I had felt about England since I was fifteen.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you have plans to visit London soon, then?&#x201d; Opal asked. <br><br>&#x201c;No, not soon. Someday maybe.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe sooner than later,&#x201d; Opal said cheerfully. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll find London to be a delightful city.&#x201d;<br><br>I leaned forward in my best tea-party posture and shared my small secret with Opal. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve always had a hopeless crush on Big Ben.&#x201d;<br><br>Opal studied me as she swallowed a nibble of her gingersnap. Kellie, of course, knew of my fascination with all things British but particularly the top tourist sights of London. However, when the disclosure of my long-held wish was followed by a pensive silence, she moved the conversation to another topic.<br><br>&#x201c;What sort of decorating ideas did you have in mind for your apartment, Opal?&#x201d;<br><br>Turning her attention to Kellie, Opal said, &#x201c;I am ready for a complete change. I would like a more cheerful color for these walls. Yellow, I think. One can live within the belly of a pale salmon for only so long.&#x201d;<br><br>She unfolded a prepared list and read to us her extensive changes.<br><br>Kellie listened thoughtfully. &#x201c;You have some lovely pieces of furniture. Once the walls are painted, these dark woods will look much different than they do now. I know an excellent upholsterer who could re-cover your wingback chair and give it a new look.&#x201d;<br><br>"That would be fine. Just so long as none of the colors is pink. Nothing pink.&#x201d; Opal rose from her chair with surprising agility and reached into her pocketbook. &#x201c;For what amount should I draft the check?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How about if we draw up an agreement first?&#x201d; Kellie suggested. &#x201c;It will take me a little time to put together a preliminary proposal. I could return later this week, if you like.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Lovely. I will expect you on Friday at the same time. Would that suit you both?&#x201d; <br><br>Kellie and I exchanged glances. I wasn&#x2019;t part of the arrangement, but I didn&#x2019;t have a particular reason to bow out at this point.<br><br>&#x201c;Friday would be fine,&#x201d; Kellie answered for both of us.<br><br>And that&#x2019;s how our regular teatimes with Opal began.<br><br>Kellie poured herself into the transformation of Opal&#x2019;s little nest, and I assisted in small ways. I hit an excellent sale at a fabric store and found the exact material we were after for the cushions on the four straight-backed chairs. I also was able to snag superior quality sheets at an outlet store and a gorgeous pale yellow matelass� bedspread from Portugal.<br><br>The entire redecorating process took a little over a month, and the results were stunning. Kellie and I were greeted by name at the front desk whenever we arrived at Sunshine Manor, and Kellie soon had requests for renovations from two other residents.<br><br>We were on our way to pay our final official visit to Opal when Kellie pulled into the parking area and said, &#x201c;You know what I like about doing all this for Opal? I like helping someone who can&#x2019;t drive around town or pick up a paintbrush and make these changes on her own. It was the same way with my aunt. If this is the last home she&#x2019;ll have, she needs it to be lovely.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I agree. And you know what I&#x2019;ve loved about this past month? I&#x2019;ve loved watching your creative side run free. I think it&#x2019;s time for you to get a business license.&#x201d;<br><br>Kellie&#x2019;s soft brown eyes always gave away her secrets long before her lips agreed to participate in any sort of confession. &#x201c;I think so too. I even have a name for the business.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Really? Let&#x2019;s hear it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;K &amp; L Interiors.&#x201d; She watched my reaction closely as we walked toward the entrance of Sunshine Manor.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a simple name,&#x201d; I said, doing an on-the-spot evaluation.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s easy to remember. K is for Kellie, right? And L is for...&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Me?&#x201d; I stopped walking. &#x201c;Me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, you. Liz, we could do this together just like we did for Opal. No one can hunt and gather like you. The bedspread and sheets you found were perfect. And that table lamp was ideal. We&#x2019;re a team. We&#x2019;ve always been great together on projects.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;But this is a business, Kellie.&#x201d;<br><br>Her eyebrows raised in an expression that said, &#x201c;So?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll think about it,&#x201d; I said, even though I already knew my answer. I didn&#x2019;t want to do anything that could jeopardize our friendship. Kellie and I had thirty-two years of friendship to our credit. However, two of those years had been absolutely terrible. I didn&#x2019;t want to be in that terrible place ever again.<br><br>&#x201c;Just think about it, Liz, okay? I talked to Martin, and he thinks it&#x2019;s great. His actual words were &#x2018;It&#x2019;s about time.&#x2019; Will you talk to Roger and see what he thinks?&#x201d;<br><br>I nodded. My affable husband probably would say it was a good idea. But I knew I wouldn&#x2019;t join Kellie&#x2019;s endeavor. We took the elevator up to Opal&#x2019;s floor and stood by her front door with a gift basket brimming with new tea towels and a tin of loose-leaf Earl Grey to replace all of Opal&#x2019;s tea we had drunk during<br>the past few weeks. <br><br>Opal let us in with a Mary Poppins sort of efficiency and invited us to have a seat on her reupholstered sofa. She thanked us for the gift basket and then proceeded to hand an envelope to each of us.<br><br>&#x201c;Go ahead and open them.&#x201d; Opal grinned in her innocent-as-a-lamb way.<br><br>This was awkward. I shouldn&#x2019;t be paid for any of the work. It was Kellie&#x2019;s gig. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t accept this.&#x201d; I slid the unopened envelope back across the coffee table. &#x201c;Thank you, though, for considering me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How can you say you can&#x2019;t accept it when you don&#x2019;t even know what&#x2019;s inside?&#x201d; Opal was on her feet, rosy faced with excitement.<br><br>&#x201c;Open it. Please.&#x201d; <br><br>Kellie and I opened the envelopes in unison. Inside we found airline tickets to what I always had considered the most romantic sounding airport name in the Western world: Heathrow.<br><br>I was holding a ticket to my childhood wish in my hands. Too stunned to cry, I gleamed. That&#x2019;s what Kellie said later. She said my face was so red and radiant I was shooting gleam-beams all over the room.<br><br>Kellie immediately began the string of questions. All the answers from Opal started with yes. Yes, this was for real. Yes, Opal was sure she wanted to do this. Yes, she remembered my saying on our first visit that I had always wanted to go to England. Yes, the tickets were booked for next Monday. And, yes, she knew that we had current passports because she had slipped that question into a conversation two weeks ago.<br><br>I calmed down, but my smile stayed at full sail. Opal poured the tea. Kellie sat in sweet, stunned silence. Both of us had just put the china teacups to our lips when Opal pulled out her final surprise of the day.<br><br>&#x201c;We are going to have such a lovely time.&#x201d;</p><h2>Crucible: The Long End of the Great War and the Birth of a New World, 1917-1924</h2><p><b>The gripping story of the years that ended the Great War and launched Europe and America onto the roller coaster of the twentieth century, Crucible is filled with all-too-human tales of exuberant dreams, dark fears, and the absurdities of chance</b><br>In Petrograd, a fire is lit.

This is the Britain of mist-drenched forests and unpredictable sea-frets: of wraith-like fog banks, druidic mistletoe and peculiar creatures that lurk, half-unseen, in the undergrowth, tantalising and teasing just at the periphery of human vision. How have the remarkably persistent folkloric traditions of the British Isles formed and been formed by the identities and psyches of those who inhabit them? In her sparkling new history, Carolyne Larrington explores the diverse ways in which a myriad of imaginary and fantastical beings has moulded the cultural history of the nation. Fairies, elves and goblins here tread purposefully, sometimes malignly, over an eerie, preternatural landscape that also conceals brownies, selkies, trows, knockers, boggarts, land-wights, Jack o'Lanterns, Barguests, the sinister Nuckleavee, or water-horse, and even Black Shuck: terrifying hell-hound of the Norfolk coast with eyes of burning coal.<br>Focusing on liminal points where the boundaries between this world and that of the supernatural grow thin those marginal tide-banks, saltmarshes, floodplains, moors and rock-pools wherein mystery lies the author shows how mythologies of Mermen, Green men and Wild-men have helped and continue to help human beings deal with such ubiquitous concerns as love and lust, loss and death and continuity and change. Evoking the Wild Hunt, the ghostly bells of Lyonesse and the dread fenlands haunted by Grendel, and ranging the while from Shetland to Jersey and from Ireland to East Anglia, this is a book that will captivate all those who long for the wild places: the mountains and chasms where Gog, Magog and their fellow giants lie in wait."</p></p><p>Carolyne Larrington is Fellow and Tutor in Medieval English Literature at St John&#39;s College, Oxford.

Acclaim for his first novel, Arkansas, led to his appointment as John &amp; Renee Grisham Fellow in Creative Writing at the University of Mississippi.<p> With <i>Citrus County</i> John Brandon joins the ranks of writers like Denis Johnson, Joy Williams, Mary Robison and Tom Drury, writers whose wild flights feel more likely than a heap of what we&#x2019;ve come to expect from literature, by calmly reminding us that the world is far more startling than most fiction is. He subverts the expectations of an adolescent novel by staying true to the wild incongruities of adolescence, and subverts the expectations of a crime novel by giving us people who are more than criminals and victims. The result is a great story in great prose, a story that keeps you turning pages even as you want to slow to savor them, full of characters who are real because they are so unlikely."<br> <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"I finished the novel a true believer: that <i>Citrus County</i> is gorgeous and deserves to be read widely; and that John Brandon is a great young writer who can and probably will do just about anything."<br> Lauren Groff, <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br>"[Brandon] focuses not on the charms of manatees and meandering rivers but on decaying strip malls, abandoned subdivisions and the claustrophobic side of small-town life. He gives us a vividly realistic picture of a place teeming with swamps, sinkholes and insects, "creatures with stingers and pincers and scorn in their hearts" and a human population with much the same attitude. Brandon draws his characters so deftly that we can be horrified and intrigued by them at once, and his plot just as deftly avoids cliches."<br> Colette Bancroft, <i>St. Petersburg Times</i><br><br>"If you care at all about books, and what they can do, then this dirty realism is for you. There are very few writers who are as adept at stripping a sentence down to its very essence; nor are there many whose sentences leave a reader so black and blue."<br> John Hood, <i>Miami Sun-Post</i><br><br>"[A] chilling and dispiriting new novel... this book is impossible to put down."<br> Jim Ross, <i>Ocala Star-Banner</i><br><br>"<i>Citrus County</i> luxuriates in the blighted majesty of rural America. The narrative is bracing, concerning teenage lovers who find themselves in a true-crime caper gone awry. What makes [Brandon] unique is his empathy toward the community at large. He is concerned not only with the key players, but also with the people affected by their actions, those characters usually ignored like the collateral damage many authors consider them to be. What results is a novel suffused with musky swamp air, teenage love, and mosquito bites."<br> Paul M. Davis, <i>SF Weekly</i><br><br>"[<i>Citrus County</i> is] not an easy book. One doesn't want to imagine that cold-blooded quasi-sociopaths are on the local eighth grade track team. But Brandon's unflinching look at the devastated inner life of his characters is so unerring that it's hard to look away. Exactly as they planned, by unleashing their most macabre impulses these characters become more vibrant, impossible to ignore."<br> Janet Potter, <i>Bookslut</i><br><br>"John Brandon's macabre novel Citrus County is at once touching, funny, and terrifying. Definitely an odd (and extremely rare) combination, but Brandon is a master at creating greatly flawed, believable characters who jump off the page and into our memories. Brandon's debut novel Arkansas greatly impressed me and landed on my favorite novels of 2008 list. Citrus County is a worthy successor, a book that haunts as well as it entertains."<br> <i>Largehearted Boy</i><br><br>"Last night I stayed up late because I had to finish John Brandon's upcoming novel <i>Citrus County</i>. And when I say I had to finish, I mean I was compelled! Gripped! Creeped out! I was nervous about what might happen to the various characters in their various states of peril! John Brandon is a wonderful writer in a literary way but not MERELY. I mean, there's real suspense. Sometimes writers get all beautiful on you and forget to remind you to turn the pages. Not John Brandon! He does it all."<br> Jack Pendarvis<br><br> Pursues relentlessly what each of us might find daily in a Florida town The purity of thought and of unadorned line are remarkable.&#x201d;<br> Barry Hannah<br><br> John Brandon is my favorite new writer. His debut, <i>Arkansas</i>, was hilarious and at the same time disturbing in its detached violence. It set a high bar, and <i>Citrus County</i> nudges that bar even higher. This is a writer to watch, to reread, and to envy.&#x201d;<br> Tom Franklin<br><br> Brandon writes of fatigue, longing, and finally love, with an energy and wit that is victorious and entirely his own.&#x201d;<br> Deb Olin Unferth<br><br> <i>Citrus County</i> is a real charmer, infused with a kind of rueful hilarity that reminded me of the great Tom Drury. The book makes you laugh even as it breaks your heart, and it may be, among other things, one of the best books about junior high ever written.&#x201d;<br> Dan Chaon<br><br> John Brandon is a prose marksman half Denis Johnson, half Elmore Leonard.&#x201d;<br> Davy Rothbart<br><br> John Brandon isn&#x2019;t the only writer documenting the dissolving of American communities, but he may be the funniest. His criminals are like no others I know, and his dialogue feels like the wild original of something domesticated in most novels.&#x201d;<br> Marshall Klimasewiski<br></p></p><h2>Contract Law, Selected Source Materials Annotated (Selected Statutes)</h2><p>This best-selling supplement contains the U.C.C.

But impetuous Viscount Raoul de Chagny is in love with Christine, and he and his brother, Count Philippe, are swept into the phantom&#x2019;s deadly illusion with horrifying consequences.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Police reports, newspaper clippings, and witness interviews help a sleuthing narrator reconstruct the events of French author <b>Gaston Leroux</b>&#x2019;s most famous tale, one that had a significant impact on contemporary detective fiction.<i></i>First published<i></i>in 1911, <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i> has since been the basis for many adaptations, including Lon Chaney&#x2019;s silent film and Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x2019;s Tony award-winning Broadway musical. Today, this thriller is recognized not only as a compelling yarn with gothic overtones, but an engrossing romance of stirring theatricality.</p><p><b>Isabel Roche</b> has a Ph.D. in French literature from New York University and teaches at Bennington College in Vermont. She wrote the book <i>Character and Meaning in the Novels of Victor Hugo</i> and has published articles in <i>The French Review</i> and <i>French Forum</i>.<b>From Isabel Roche&#x2019;s Introduction to <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i></b>&nbsp;Long before <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i> became a perennial film favorite and a Broadway fixture of enormous success, it was a novel of modest critical and commercial acclaim, written by one Gaston Leroux, a lawyer turned journalist turned novelist. First published serially in the newspaper <i>Le Gaulois</i> from September 1909 to January 1910, <i>Le Fant�me de l&#x2019;Op�ra</i> might well have shared the fate of the bulk of Leroux&#x2019;s fiction&#x2014;which is largely unread today&#x2014;had it not been for its elevation to the big screen with Rupert Julian&#x2019;s 1925 film version starring Lon Chaney as the phantom. Chaney&#x2019;s astonishing performance in the role, coupled with a tale that lends itself particularly well to visual rendering, inspired such a considerable number of remakes in various mediums over the course of the twentieth century that the phantom&#x2019;s story has taken on a life of its own. <br>Indeed, readers picking up Leroux&#x2019;s novel for the first time may be surprised to discover the extent to which the novel differs from the many versions that they have seen or heard. For while the adaptations have generally remained faithful to the novel&#x2019;s core themes&#x2014;attraction and repulsion, artistry and suffering<b>,</b> love, loss, and redemption&#x2014;they have taken more extreme liberties in regard to the narrative elements: Leroux&#x2019;s original plot has been streamlined and at times greatly altered, the pacing quickened, and the journalistic tone of the novel has been expunged in favor of dramatic suspense. Whether or not the many cinematic interpretations have improved upon Leroux&#x2019;s original is a matter of taste; what is more certain is that <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i>, the novel, merits our attention: Not only does the very readable story capture the mood and sentiment of the years immediately leading up to the golden period of art and innovation that would later be dubbed <i>La Belle �poque</i> (literally, &#x201c;The Beautiful Age&#x201d;), it also serves as an interesting marker in the history and evolution of the French novel. It is indebted to the Gothic tradition and the fantastic literature and serial novel of the nineteenth century; at the same time it is a precursor of the twentieth-century detective and mystery story that would flourish both abroad and in France with the fiction of Agatha Christie and Georges Simenon, among others.<br>Leroux had already published nearly a third of the<b> </b>more than thirty novels that would appear in his lifetime when <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i> came out in 1910. A well-respected and talented journalist with a law degree and particular strengths in the areas of court and political reporting, he had turned to full-time fiction writing in 1907 after becoming weary with the pressures and travel required by his job. This shift allowed him to wed his love of writing with his imaginative impulses, which had been nourished by his journeys to such exotic locales as Russia, Africa, and Asia, and Leroux churned out relatively successful potboilers with an impressive regularity. As an art and theatre critic for the newspaper <i>Le Matin</i> at an earlier point in his career, he had visited the Nouvel Op�ra (opened in 1875 and known today as the Palais Garnier or the Op�ra Garnier) many times and was impressed by the building&#x2019;s grandiose and imposing architectural design. The catalyst for <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i>, by his own account, was a private visit to the usually sealed-off lower depths of the Opera House during which his curiosity and his imagination were piqued<b> </b>by both the preserved traces of the building&#x2019;s historical and political importance and the palpable sense of secrecy that the underground labyrinth evoked. <br>The circumstances surrounding the construction of the Op�ra Garnier were the material of legend and lore. On an 1858 visit to the then-official opera house on the rue le Peletier, Emperor Napol�on III (nephew of Napol�on Bonaparte) was the target of a politically motivated attack that ultimately spared him but resulted in the death of 150 people. It was at this moment that the Emperor conceived of replacing the rue le Peletier building (which had been designated the home of the Paris Opera following the assassination of the Duc de Berry in 1820 at the previous opera house at the square Louvois) with a new, more secure structure (with a private, imperial entrance), one whose grandeur would be representative of his ambitious reign. He gave his controversial city planner, Baron Haussmann, who was in the process of reconfiguring Paris with a new layout, the task of organizing a competition to select an architect to design the new building, which would be one of the hubs of his plan of connected boulevards and avenues. Chosen from among the nearly 200 entries was that of the more or less unknown Charles Garnier. Garnier impressed the judges by labeling his eclectic architectural approach &#x201c;Napoleon III style,&#x201d; and the resulting structure indeed remains the prime example of Second Empire construction in Paris. &nbsp;Erecting such a daunting edifice&#x2014;distinguished by its imposing polygonal shape, crowning dome, ornately sculptured facade, and gigantic interior complete with an enormous foyer and a majestic, gilded double staircase&#x2014;was a monumental task that was stymied during nearly a twenty-year period by financing issues, construction difficulties, and most directly, political upheaval. The French defeat at Sedan during the Franco&#x2013;Prussian war of 1870&#x2013;1871 resulted in the Emperor&#x2019;s capture. A Third Republic was proclaimed, but the fragile provisional government was then menaced by the siege of the capital by German troops. The still-unfinished Opera House was designated an arsenal and warehouse, and then became the headquarters and eventually a military prison of the Communards&#x2014;the name given to working-class Parisians who formed their own army in an effort to overthrow those at the helm of the new French regime following France&#x2019;s capitulation. The violent civil revolution lasted three months and resulted in the loss of thousands of lives before the rebellion was squashed by government forces in May 1871. It was not until 1875 that Garnier&#x2019;s building&#x2014;whose cost had escalated to more than 47 million francs&#x2014;was finally ready to be unveiled with a gala event thrown more to demonstrate the political stability attained by the Third Republic than to celebrate the architect&#x2019;s achievement (Garnier, in fact, was famously asked to pay to attend the opening!). The Paris Opera&#x2014;which also had its own ballet company&#x2014;would draw an increasingly large public during the next few decades as cultural appreciation took on a new importance as part of the <i>joie de vivre</i> mentality that enveloped France before World War I.</p><h2>Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (Puffin + Pantone)</h2><p><b>Color your bookshelf with&nbsp;Puffin + Pantone!&nbsp;A collection of classic novels paired with their perfect color match.&nbsp;</b><br><br>Introducing a bold, bright new take on your favorite books.

When she's not traipsing after a rabbit into Wonderland, she's gallivanting off into the topsy-turvy world behind the drawing-room looking glass. In <i>Through the Looking Glass</i>, Lewis Carroll's masterful and zany sequel to <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i>, she makes more eccentric acquaintances, including Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the White Queen, and a somewhat grumpy Humpty Dumpty. Through a giant and elaborate chess game, Alice explores this odd country, where one must eat dry biscuits to quench thirst, and run like the wind to stay in one place. As in life, Alice must stay on her toes to learn the rules of this game. <i>Through the Looking Glass</i> immediately took its rightful place beside its partner on the shelf of eternal classics. And luckily for generations of enraptured children, Carroll was again able to persuade John Tenniel to create the fantastic woodblock engravings that have become so indelibly associated with the Alice stories. For almost 130 years, Alice's curious adventures have amused, perplexed, and delighted readers, young and old. This gorgeous, deluxe boxed set of both volumes contains engravings from Tenniel's original woodblocks that were discovered in a London bank in 1985, and reproduced for the first time here. "'What is the use of a book,' thought Alice, 'without pictures?'" What indeed? (All ages)In 1862 Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, a shy Oxford mathematician with a stammer, created a story about a little girl tumbling down a rabbit hole. Thus began the immortal adventures of Alice, perhaps the most popular heroine in English literature. Countless scholars have tried to define the charm of the <i>Alice</i> books--with those wonderfully eccentric characters the Queen of Hearts, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Cheshire Cat, Mock Turtle, the Mad Hatter et al.--by proclaiming that they really comprise a satire on language, a political allegory, a parody of Victorian children's literature, even a reflection of contemporary ecclesiastical history. Perhaps, as Dodgson might have said, <i>Alice</i> is no more than a dream, a fairy tale about a trials and tribulations of growing up--or down, or all turned round--as seen through the expert eyes of a child.</p><h2>Palabra abierta (World Languages)</h2><p>Palabra abierta, 2/e, is a theme-driven and process-based Spanish composition text designed to develop advanced students&#39; critical-thinking skills and academic writing proficiency.

Whether directed towards social intolerance or attitudes of warlike aggression, these right-wing citizens have claimed a power of influence that far exceeds their numbers. <i>Blessed Are the Peacemakers</i> collects the sayings of Jesus, selected by Wendell Berry, who contributes an essay of introduction. This is a book of inspiration and prayerful compassion, a ringing call to action at a time when our country and the world it once led stand at a dangerous crossroads.</p></p><p>Berrys themes are reflections of his life: friends, family, the farm, the nature around us as well as within. He speaks strongly for himself and sometimes for the lost heart of the country. As he has borne witness to the world for eight decades, what he offers us now in this new collection of poems is of incomparable value.Thomas Jefferson famously culled from the Gospels to present Jesus the Enlightenment rationalist but, knowing that public Christians of the time wouldn't take it well, left the selection for posthumous publication. Berry aims his gospel sampler first at public Christians, and he publishes immediately because he has prophetic fish to fry. Wealthy and powerful Christians continue the age-old processes of warring for vengeance and self-interest, he says, despite what Jesus said about loving our neighbors--and our enemies--and forgiving one another. To make those sayings stand out, he gathers passages including the parable of the Good Samaritan, the story of the woman taken in adultery, <i>and</i> the hard teachings about coming "not to send peace, but a sword." After the selections, he discusses "The Burden of the Gospels," which is essentially the injunction to follow Christ and keep his commandments, and consequently to believe in the world's sanctity and the human duty of stewardship of creation. Berry restates an old message as beautifully as he has stated anything in his long, distinguished career. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Touching yet humorous, naive and yet at the same time highly sophisticated, &#34;Daphnis and Chloe&#34; is the story of a shepard boy and girl who fall desperately in love and find themselves facing enormous obstacles to their happiness. Goethe said of the story: &#34;One would do well to read it every year, to be instructed by it again and again, and to receive anew the impression of its great beauty.&#34; Chagall&#39;s lus lithographs - reproduced here in full color - encapuslate the lyricism and sensual frankness of this tale. In creating his prints the artist was inspired by first-hand impressions of Greece and by memories of folktales from his homeland. Chagall&#39;s vibrant splashes of color, fluid line work, and simple yet eloquent faces and figures capture both the liveliness and poignancy of a timeless pastoral text.An ancient Greek love story written by the poet Longus, <i>Daphnis and Chloe </i>is set on the island of Lesbos, where two foundlings are raised with care and find great joy in nature and their simple lives as shepherds. Absolute innocents, young Daphnis and Chloe fall in love, but they don't know what love is. As they puzzle over their curious predicament, their beauty attracts would-be seducers and scheming suitors, and their happiness is threatened on all fronts. As their guardians confer and nymphs and gods get involved, Longus weaves a pastoral romance radiant with the beauty of nature and the nature of innocence. This indelible, sweetly humorous, and sensuous pastoral tale has inspired Western writers, composers, and artists for centuries, and no story is more aptly suited to the mythic and erotic sensibility of Marc Chagall, who illustrated Longus' timeless masterpiece with 42 exquisite lithographs. Dreamily atmospheric, sinuously graceful, jewel-like in hue, infused with magic, these are works of buoyant beauty gorgeously reproduced in this little gem of a book. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Set in the 1980s, <em>The Fixed Period</em> describes an imaginary, antipodean ex-colony governed by a President who views himself as a benefactor of the human race, Orwellian double-speak and gunboat diplomacy. This is Trollope's strangest and most chilling novel.</p><p>As young adult, Trollope endured seven years of poverty in the General Post Office in London before accepting a better-paying position as postal surveyor in Banagher, Ireland in 1841. The years in Ireland formed the basis of his second career delineating clerical life in small cathedral towns.</p><h2>Grammatical Concepts 101 for Biblical Hebrew: Learning Biblical Hebrew Grammatical Concepts Through English Grammar</h2><p>Many students have forgotten, or never learned, the basic grammatical concepts needed for studying Biblical Hebrew. Explanations of these concepts in Hebrew grammar textbooks are either too skimpy or too complex. <i>Grammatical Concepts 101 for Biblical Hebrew</i> fills this gap. In this complement to standard classroom grammars, veteran language instructor and Hebrew scholar Gary Long revisits English grammar in order to teach more effectively concepts that are specific to Hebrew. <p> Arranged to supplement teaching grammars, each chapter takes up individual concepts, first explaining how the concept works in English, then illustrating its use in Biblical Hebrew. Long explains, for example,<i> voice, tense, aspect, mood, participles, independent and dependent clauses, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, even discourse analysis</i> and <i>translation theory</i> in easy-to-understand language. Abundant English and Hebrew examples illustrate each concept, most of them visually analyzed. Glosses and translations help students grasp the Hebrew examples.</p></p><p>Gary A. Long (PhD University of Chicago) is Professor of Biblical Studies at Bethel University, St. Paul, Minnesota."In the real world of language pedagogy, where students' knowledge of English grammar is patchy at best, this volume is a crucial counterpart to textbooks of Biblical Hebrew. Lucid and accessible explanations of grammatical concepts and terms provide students with the framework they need to understand language structures. Armed with this deeper appreciation of English grammar, students will be better prepared to think about the structures of Biblical Hebrew."<br>--Cynthia L. Miller, Department of Hebrew and Semitic Studies, University of Wisconsin, Madison -- <i>Review</i></p><h2>Parallel Commentary on the New Testament</h2><p>A parallel New Testament commentary that includes the text of the King James Version and applicable portions from the sermons from Charles Spurgeon on each left-hand page, and excerpts from the writings of John Wesley and Matthew Henry on each right-hand page. Read the biblical text and glance across the page to get the interpretations and meditations of these giants of the faith.</p><p>John Wesley (17031791) was an eighteenth century Anglican clergyman and Christian theologian who was the founder of the Methodist movement. Methodism had three rises, the first at Oxford University with the founding of the so-called Holy Club, the second while Wesley was parish priest in Savannah, Georgia, and the third in London after Wesleys return to England. The movement took form from its third rise in the early 1740s when Wesley, along with others, began itinerant field preaching and the subsequently founded religious societies for the formation of believers. This was the first widely successful evangelical movement in Britain. Wesleys Methodist Connexion included societies throughout England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland before spreading to other parts of the English-speaking world and beyond. He divided his religious societies further into classes and bands for intensive accountability and religious instruction.</p><h2>The Time Machine: A Norton Critical Edition (Norton Critical Editions)</h2><p><p><strong><em>The Time Machine</em> (1895) is H. G. Wells&#x2019;s first published novel as well as his most enduring and influential work.</strong></p> Intrigued by the possibilities of time travel as a student and inspired as a journalist by the great scientific advances of the Victorian Age, Wells drew on his own scientific publications&#x2015;on evolution, degeneration, species extinction, geologic time, and biology&#x2015;in writing <em>The Time Machine</em>. This Norton Critical Edition is based on the first London edition of the novel. It is accompanied by detailed explanatory annotations and &#x201c;A Note on the Text.&#x201d; <p>&#x201c;Backgrounds and Contexts&#x201d; is organized thematically into four sections: &#x201c;The Evolution of <em>The Time Machine</em>&#x201d; presents alternative versions and installments and excerpts of the author&#x2019;s time-travel story; &#x201c;Wells&#x2019;s Scientific Journalism (1891&#x2013;94)&#x201d; focuses on the scientific topics central to the novel; &#x201c;Wells on <em>The Time Machine</em>&#x201d; reprints the prefaces to the 1924, 1931, and 1934 editions; and &#x201c;Scientific and Social Contexts&#x201d; collects five widely read texts by the Victorian scientists and social critics Edwin Ray Lankester, Thomas Henry Huxley, Benjamin Kidd, William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), and Balfour Stewart and Peter Guthrie Tait.</p><p>&#x201c;Criticism&#x201d; includes three important early reviews of <em>The Time Machine</em> from the <em>Spectator</em>, the <em>Daily Chronicle</em>, and <em>Pall Mall Magazine</em> as well as eight critical essays that reflect our changing emphases in reading and appreciating this futuristic novel. Contributors include Yevgeny Zamyatin, Bernard Bergonzi, Kathryn Hume, Elaine Showalter, John Huntington, Paul A. Cantor and Peter Hufnagel, Colin Manlove, and Roger Luckhurst.</p><p>A Chronology and Selected Bibliography are also included.</p></p><p>In The Time Machine Wells pioneers the concept of travel in the &#39;Fourth Dimension&#39; and speculates about the ultimate decay of the human species. The world of the effete Eloi and ape-like Morlocks, the age of giant crabs, and the final portrayal of the heat-death of the sun constitute an unforgettable vision of the future. The Time Traveller&#39;s narrow escape from the remote descendants of humanity is paralleled by Edward Prendick&#39;s horrifying adventures among the Beast Folk of The Island of Doctor Moreau. Moreau, a ruthless vivisector, chooses an uninhabited Pacific island for his attempts to change animals into human beings on the operating table. Prendick soon fears that he, too, may become a victim of Moreau&#39;s experiments. Even at their most bleakly pessimistic and ironic, these stories testify to the resources of human courage and ingenuity. This edition offers authoritative texts of both novels, explanatory notes, and an introduction setting them in the context of Wells&#39;s life and thought.Stephen Arata is Mayo Distinguished Teaching Professor and Associate Professor of English at the University of Virginia.

Parrillo experienced multiculturalism early as the son of a second-generation Italian American father and Irish/German American mother. He grew up in an ethnically diverse neighborhood, developing friendships and teenage romances with second- and third-generation Dutch, German, Italian, and Polish Americans. As he grew older, he developed other friendships that frequently crossed racial and religious lines.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> <p>Professor Parrillo came to the field of sociology after first completing a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in business management and a master&#x2019;s degree in English. After teaching high school English and then serving as a college administrator, he took his first sociology course when he began doctoral studies at Rutgers University. Inspired by a discipline that scientifically investigates social issues, he changed his major and completed his degree in sociology.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> <p>Leaving his administrative post but staying at William Paterson University, Prof. Parrillo has since taught sociology for more than 30 years.

Many people know her as the reclusive Chicago nanny who wandered the city for decades, constantly snapping photographs, which were unseen until they were discovered in a seemingly abandoned storage locker. They revealed her to be an inadvertent master of twentieth-century American street photography. Not long after, the news broke that Maier had recently died and had no surviving relatives. Soon the whole world knew about her preternatural work, shooting her to stardom almost overnight.<br> &nbsp;<br> But, as Pamela Bannos reveals in this meticulous and passionate biography, this story of the nanny savant has blinded us to Maier&#x2019;s true achievements, as well as her intentions. Most important, Bannos argues, Maier was not a nanny who moonlighted as a photographer; she was a photographer who supported herself as a nanny. In <i>Vivian Maier: A Photographer&#x2019;s Life and Afterlife</i>, Bannos contrasts Maier&#x2019;s life with the mythology that strangers&#x2014;mostly the men who have profited from her work&#x2014;have created around her absence. Bannos shows that Maier was extremely conscientious about how her work was developed, printed, and cropped, even though she also made a clear choice never to display it. She places Maier&#x2019;s fierce passion for privacy alongside the recent spread of her work around the world, and she explains Maier&#x2019;s careful adjustments of photographic technique, while explaining how the photographs have been misconstrued or misidentified. As well, Bannos uncovers new information about Maier&#x2019;s immediate family, including her difficult brother, Karl&#x2014;relatives that once had been thought not to exist.<br> &nbsp;<br> This authoritative and engrossing biography shows that the real story of Vivian Maier, a true visionary artist, is even more compelling than the myth.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<b>Pamela Bannos</b> is professor of photography in Northwestern University&#x2019;s Department of Art Theory and Practice.<br> &nbsp;<p>"Stories--like snapshots--are shaped by people, and for particular purposes. There's always an angle. A new biography, <i>Vivian Maier: A Photographer&#x2019;s Life and Afterlife</i>, by Pamela Bannos, strives to rescue Maier all over again, this time from the men who promulgated the Maier myth and profited off her work. . . . &nbsp;Almost point by point, Bannos refutes how Maier has been marketed.&nbsp; . . . The achievement of Bannos's intelligent, irritable self-reflexive study is in its restraint. She unseats the ghost and restores to us the woman--but in her own words and images, and without psychologizing<b>.</b> It's a portrait as direct as any of Maier's, and what a distinct pleasure it is to meet her gaze again."</p> (Parul Sehgal <i>New York Times</i>)<br><br>"Offers a level of detail and thoughtful reflection that no previous book on Maier has. . . . This book is by far the finest yet published on the artist. I believe it will become a classic in the field." (<i>Art in America</i>)<br><br>"Bannos offers a clear-eyed investigation of Maier's life, aiming to penetrate the myths surrounding her and to assess her stature as an artist. . . . In alternating chapters, Bannos juxtaposes Maier's biography with her afterlife. She effectively contextualizes Maier's aesthetics within the history of photography, and she makes a persuasive case for her talent and originality. In the end, though, the author is left with unanswered questions about Maier's personal life, her motivations to photograph, and her artistic aims. A sympathetic portrait of an artist who remains elusive."<br><br> &nbsp; (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)<br><br>"Patiently and lucidly detailed by Pamela Bannos in her nearly forensic biography--which unties many knots and brings order to what was previously a chaotic welter of information and misinformation." (Luc Sante <i>Bookforum</i>)<br><br>"At last, we have a way of separating the individual from the myths that have been constructed around her. The revelation of greater context is the beating heart of Bannos's book, and she&#x2019;s clear from the start that she sees it as an act of feminist reclamation." (<i>Nation</i>)<br><br>"Meticulously researched. . . . Bannos's biography is a vital contribution to understanding the historical relevance of Maier's work and an important challenge to the way in which Maier's work and legacy have been represented thus far."<br> &nbsp; (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"By carefully analyzing the artist's images, Bannos skillfully tracks her entire adult life: work history, where she lived and traveled, and her interests, and is able to look past the mystique of the 'eccentric nanny with a camera' to tell the true Maier story. . . . The book's strengths are Bannos's exhaustive research and her ability to connect the greater history of photography in to the account of Maier's curious life. This extraordinary work is recommended for all art history and photography enthusiasts."<br> &nbsp; (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>"Bannos's engrossing, meticulously researched biography sensitively reconstructs Vivian Maier's very private life in conjunction with her now massive public legacy as a visionary photographer. Many questions remain and always will. However, Bannos's comprehensive narrative ensures that Vivian Maier's story and the treasure trove of her work will live on, transcending the world of photography. . . . A fascinating glimpse into the life of an eccentric, legendary photographer whose work came to prominence only with her death."

A fascinating glimpse into the life of an eccentric, legendary photographer whose work came to prominence only after her death." (<i>Shelf Awareness for Readers</i>)<br><br>"Her approach is refreshing--a clear-eyed, empirical account that counters the willfully obscure, ego-driven yarns spun by the buyers. In this light, <i>A Photographer&#x2019;s Life and Afterlife</i> is a work of real integrity in a field lacking such a genuine spirit of inquiry. . . . She directs her energies on getting the counternarrative right, and this she manages admirably. . . . In many ways, Maier and the various ways she has been understood, from the 'mystery nanny' to the 'street photographer,' is a construction and reflection of our time and much less of her own. This is what makes Bannos&#x2019;s biography so welcome. For the most part she lets Maier emerge simply from what she did--her travels, her photos, her actions. Only in her closing remarks does Bannos give us the swiftest brush strokes of a portrait, which is worth remembering for it is one of the most lucid and accurate summations of Maier's work to date."<br> &nbsp; (<i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i>)</p><h2>The Computer and the Brain (The Silliman Memorial Lectures Series)</h2><p>This book, composed of material prepared for the Silliman Lectures by john von Neumann before his death, represents the views of one of the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century on the analogies between computing machines adn the living human brain. He concludes that the brain operates in part digitally, in part analogically, but uses a peculiar statistical language unlike that employed in the operation of man-made computers.</p><p>Whether they think that artificial intelligence is impossible or inevitable, most people have highly polarized views on it. John von Neumann, genius, mathematician, and inventor of the nearly ubiquitous computer architecture that bears his name, blazed trails for both camps in <i>The Computer and the Brain</i>. This short book, which was written originally for Yale's Silliman lectures, but published posthumously, summarizes his views on machine and biological intelligence with unprecedented clarity and precision. His understanding of neuroscience was that of a brilliant and strongly motivated amateur at the end of the 1950s--good enough to take on the problem, but by no means matching his comprehension of the machines to which he had devoted much of his professional life. Still, his take on intracranial computation is stunningly prescient--he looks beyond the then-fashionable digital metaphors to suggest a semi-analog strategy that uses parallel processing to make up for its deficiency in speed. Prominent neuroscientific thinkers Paul M. Churchland and Patricia S. Churchland provide a brief, enlightening foreword to this second edition, placing the author's thinking in context and grounding the reader in the scientific milieu that gave rise to <i>The Computer and the Brain</i>. Although his computer architecture slowly is growing obsolete, von Neumann has given us a more lasting legacy in his thinking about thinking. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>At the time of his death in February 1957, John von Neumann, renowned for his theory of games and his work at the Electronic Computer Project at the Institute for Advanced Study, was serving as a member of the Atomic Energy Commission. Paul M. and Patricia S. Churchland are professors of philosophy at the University of California, San Diego.</p><h2>The Third Target: A J. B.

This book examines the sources of royal women's power and assesses the reactions of contemporaries, which ranged from loyal devotion to armed opposition. By examining political action in the context of household networks, Leslie Peirce demonstrates that female power was a logical, indeed an intended, consequence of political structures. Royal women were custodians of sovereign power, training their sons in its use and exercising it directly as regents when necessary. Furthermore, they played central roles in the public culture of sovereignty--royal ceremonial, monumental building, and patronage of artistic production. <em>The Imperial Harem</em> argues that the exercise of political power was tied to definitions of sexuality. Within the dynasty, the hierarchy of female power, like the hierarchy of male power, reflected the broader society's control for social control of the sexually active.<br></p><p><br><strong>Leslie P. Peirce</strong> is Professor of History and Near Eastern Studies, University of California, Berkeley.<br><br>"The harem described in Leslie P. Peirce's fascinating book is not the lascivious sexual playground conceived by the Western imagination but the locus of power in the Ottoman empire....The general thesis of this outstanding book--that the power wielded by the women of the imperial harem was real, and that it stood in an organic relation to broader Ottoman political traditions and practice--will be widely accepted."--<em>American Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"Peirce's work effectively reinforces recent work on the post-S�leymanic period, while at the same time revising scholarship about the imperial harem and the dynastic family. In doing so, her book is a significant contribution to the field."--<em>The Historian</em><p></p><br>"<em>The Imperial Harem</em> is the definitive book on its subject. While it is excellent reading for students of women's studies, it is an important contribution to Ottoman history as well."--<em>MESA Bulletin</em><p></p><br>"A tour de force. Peirce has brought her detailed knowledge of Ottoman harem politics to revise a fundamental question of Ottoman historiography: how did the dynasty adjust to the transformation of imperial ideology necessary in light of the regime's change from aggressive expansion to stasis."--Carl F. Petry, Northwestern University<p></p><br>"This is an excellent book, and a new departure in women's history within the Islamic field. Peirce discusses women not as a class apart, not as part of dynastic politics in the Ottoman Empire, thus shedding new light on political processes, and showing women to be an integral part of the dynasty."--Beatrice Manz, Tufts University<p></p><br>"[A] monumental study....Peirce's facility in traversing boundaries between the East and the West is striking....[an] invaluable feminist study...of interest to students and scholars of history, politics, and sociology as well as any feminist."--<em>Signs</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis</h2><p>This is the first text in a generation to re-examine the purpose of the mathematical statistics course.

Their peaceful rural life is shattered when John Rother disappears and his abandoned car is found. Has he been kidnapped? Or is his disappearance more sinister&#x2015;connected, perhaps, to his growing rather too friendly with his brother's wife?</p><p>Superintendent Meredith is called to investigate&#x2015;and begins to suspect the worst when human bones are discovered on Chalklands farmland. His patient, careful detective method begins slowly to untangle the clues as suspicion shifts from one character to the next.</p><p>This classic detective novel from the 1930s is now republished for the first time, with an introduction by the award-winning crime writer Martin Edwards.</p></p><p><p><strong>JOHN BUDE</strong> was the pseudonym of Ernest Elmore (1901&#x2013;1957), an author of the golden age of crime fiction. Elmore was a cofounder of the Crime Writers' Association, and worked in the theatre as a producer and director.</p><p>John Bude's 1936 detective story, <i>The Sussex Downs Murder</i>, is one of two novels from the British Library Crime Classics series released in May in the United States by the Poisoned Pen Press. The cleverly plotted mystery is Bude's second book featuring Superintendent Meredith, the personable, hard-working detective who had debuted in <i>The Lake District Murder</i>....Bude is especially adept at the portrayal of local characters: the Rother's garrulous housekeeper, a garage owner who claims to have a psychic eye, an anatomy professor more interested in bones than in murder. There are passages in which locals are treated like comic relief in the manner of Shakespeare....<i>The Sussex Downs Murder</i> is filled with red herrings, and if the modern reader may be able to guess at the solution to the case a bit quicker that Superintendent Meredith, there is still a good deal of pleasure in following him from lead to lead, clue to clue as he works his way to that solution.</p> (<i><b><i>BlogCritics</i></b></i>)<br><br><p>I really enjoyed this. It had the hallmarks of classic British crime, a satisfyingly meaty plot, and a good denouement. Highly recommended.</p> (<i><b>NetGalley</b></i>)<br><br><p>Working with the British Library, Poisoned Pen Press is reissuing a slew of mysteries in very stylish paperback period format, written by some forgotten (but popular in their time) writers of the Golden Age of British crime fiction. John Bude, whose real name was Ernest Elmore, was one of the founders of the Crime Writers' Association and produced 30 detective stories. This one marked the second appearance of Superintendent Meredith, a detective who goes to any length to solve crimes (he first appeared in&nbsp;<i>The Lake District Murder</i>). The mystery centers on a particularly creepy method of body disposal - after one of the two brothers who operate a farm featuring a lime kiln disappears, a thigh bone is discovered in a bag of lime delivered to a local shop. A scene that is especially startling in a book filled with jaw-dropping scenes is that of a retired anthropologist (who sometimes helps police with anatomy) picking up the thigh bone and carrying it under his arm as if it were an umbrella. The finding and piecing together of the victim's body, with its sinister but matter-of-fact tone, is worthy of Hitchcock. Superintendent Meredith, in these pre-forensic days, relies on his interrogation techniques and common deductive sense to find motive and murderer. The layers of relationships and secrets Bude unearths through his questioning are riveting. A wonderful rediscovery. <b>(starred review)</b></p> (<i><b><i>Booklist</i></b></i>)</p><h2>The Naked and the Dead: 50th Anniversary Edition</h2><p>The fiftieth-anniversary edition of an American classic, with a new introduction by the author. <p>Hailed as one of the finest novels to come out of the Second World War, The Naked and the Dead received unprecedented critical acclaim upon its publication and has since enjoyed a long and well-deserved tenure in the American canon. This fiftieth anniversary edition features a new introduction created especially for the occasion by Norman Mailer. </p><p>Written in gritty, journalistic detail, the story follows a platoon of Marines who are stationed on the Japanese-held island of Anopopei.

But by performing the essential historical task of separating what happened from what did not, and by distinguishing in this way the choices which have been made from those which have yet to be decided, it is my hope that this effort will help to establish that common basis for understanding which is essential for the debate over specific issues to proceed most effectively. This book, then, is scarcely the last word on the Owens Valley conflict: the final chapter, after all, has yet to be written.&nbsp;The story that has emerged here is at once very different and more troubling than the conventional treatments of the conflict as a simplistic political morality play. Any attempt to deal with so controversial a subject, however, is almost certain to spark controversy itself. For that reason, with the exception of a small collection of private letters, this work is constructed entirely from the published documents and other materials available to the general public, anchoring the narrative in sources the reader can consult to trace the line of my argument on any point with which he or she may disagree.

Yet Wilson is equally important for his influence on how Americans think about their Constitution and principles of government. <br><br>Woodrow Wilson and the Roots of Modern Liberalism highlights Wilson's sharp departure from the traditional principles of American government, most notably the Constitution. Ronald J. Pestritto persuasively argues that Wilson's unfailing criticism places him clearly in line with the Progressives' assault on the original principles of American constitutionalism. Drawing primarily from early writings and speeches that Wilson made during his years as a scholar, Pestritto examines the future president's clear and consistent ideologies that laid the foundation for later actions taken as a public leader. <br><br>Engaging and thought-provoking, Woodrow Wilson and the Roots of Modern Liberalism gets to the heart of Wilson's political ideologies and brings a fresh perspective to the study of American political development.</p><p>Ronald J. Pestritto is Charles and Lucia Shipley Chair in the American Constitution at Hillsdale College and a research fellow at the Claremont Institute.The 'Era of Big Government'&#x2015;and the idea that the national government ought to be adequate to any task the people ask of it&#x2015;did not creep up on America unaware. It was a deliberate project, grounded in a critique of the original Constitution, bolstered by a new political science, and guided by a thorough-going confidence in historical progress. With clarity, conviction, and plenty of evidence, R. J. Pestritto shows that, from his early days as a political scientist through his election to the presidency, Woodrow Wilson was consistently a central figure in the development of Progressivism and so of the Liberalism that dominated twentieth-century American public policy and political life. Though Wilson was no philosopher-king, Pestritto explains that our doctor-of-philosophy-president changed how we think about democracy and about America, in ways that ought to be reappraised but have yet to be undone. (James R. Stoner, Jr., Louisiana State University)<br><br>Ronald Pestritto's book is the deepest and most comprehensive treatment to date of Woodrow Wilson's political thought. Pestritto has produced a masterful study of the origins of Wilson's theoretical views, and he has carefully shown the connections between those views and Wilson's positions on major constitutional and institutional questions. All interested in American political thought will appreciate this important work. (James Ceaser, University of Virginia)<br><br>In his brilliant new book, <i>Woodrow Wilson and the Roots of Modern Liberalism</i>, Ronald Pestritto painstakingly documents Wilson's debt to Hegel. (Paul Mirengoff and Scott Johnson <i>The Daily Standard</i>)<br><br>Pestritto offers an interesting read, with Wilson as a parallel to contemporary end of history commentary. Recommended. (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>In a work that cuts against much of the existing scholarship on Wilson, Pestritto shows that Wilson held coherent and consistent political principles throughout his life, and that these principles put Wilson at the heart of the Progressive movement. Pestritto's case relies on an impressive and meticulous study of Wilson's own words&#x2015;speeches and writings taken from every stage of Wilson's life&#x2015;which makes this book all the more persuasive. (John Marini, University of Nevada, Reno)<br><br>Ronald J. Pestrito&#x2019;s book is an in-depth, methodical analysis of Wilson&#x2019;s political philosophy. This dense, but relatively short 7 chapter volume is opened by placing Wilson in context with historical thinking and the founding of America. In the introduction, Pestrito lays out the foundation for the book. He contrasts the fundamental difference between Wilson&#x2019;s political philosophy and that of the Founders. This difference stems from the framers&#x2019; core belief in inalienable, trans-historical truth and Wilson&#x2019;s belief in historicism and the adapted tenets of German philosophers, notably Hegel.

Reviewers hailed the book as "a monument to sound scholarship and graceful style" (The New York Times Book Review), "an extraordinary biography of an extraordinary man" (Christian Science Monitor), and "a fine book" (Scientific American).<br> <br> In this groundbreaking new volume, Pais undertakes a history of the physics of matter and of physical forces since the discovery of x-rays. The book attempts to relate not only what has happened over the last hundred years but why it happened the way it did, what it was like for those scientists involved, and how what at the time may have seemed a series of bizarre or unrelated events, now with hindsight emerges as a logical sequence of events.<br> <br> Pais, a noted physicist, was personally involved in many of the developments he describes, and thus <em>Inward Bound</em> , like his earlier book, is filled with unique insights into the world of big and small physics. Between 1895 and 1983, the period he covers, the smallest distances explored have shrunk a hundred millionfold, Pais notes. Along this incompletely traveled "road inward," scientists have established markers that later generations will rank among the principal monuments of the twentieth century. In alternating technical and nontechnical sections, this magisterial survey richly conveys what has been discovered about the constituents of matter, the laws to which they are subject, and the forces that act on them. But the advances have certainly not come smoothly. The book shows that these have been times of progress and stagnation, of order and chaos, of clarity and confusion, of belief and incredulity, of the conventional and the bizarre; also of revolutionaries and conservatives, of science by individuals and by consortia, of little gadgets and big machines, and of modest funds and big money.<br> <br> About the Author:<br> <br> Abraham Pais is Detlev W.

He maintains a private psychotherapy practice for children and their families in Hackensack, New Jersey.This book should be in the libraries of all clinicians who seek variety and creativity in their work with children. <i>101 More Favorite Play Therapy Techniques</i> spans art, games, puppetry, toys, and group play to suggest powerful but practical tools for therapists. Because of the wealth of techniques offered in this book, it is guaranteed to hold something of value for each of its readers. I endorse this volume 101 times over. (Janine S. Shelby, PhD, University of California, Los Angeles)<br><br>Can there REALLY be 101 MORE favorite and MEANINGFUL play therapy techniques? The answer is <i>yes</i>&#x2015;for the book editors have selected ones that are more than contributors' favorites. They are techniques that will either provide play therapists with variations on basic methods for use with children who present difficult challenges to the therapist, or offer some entirely new directions. The insightful introductions and rationales provided by the contributors are worth reading in their own right. Readers should find their knowledge base enriched and their application repertoire expanded. (Louise Guerney, PhD, RPT-S, National Institute of Relationship Enhancement, Bethesda, MD)<br><br>As if <i>101 Play Therapy Techniques</i> weren't enough, here are <i>101 More Play Therapy Techniques</i> to apply, adapt, and easily implement in a variety of settings. The user-friendly format allows busy professionals quick access to a plethora of play therapy techniques that can be used with children of all ages. This book will not become a dust collector on a bookshelf but rather a rich resource offering new and innovative play therapy techniques. Way to go, Kaduson and Schaefer! (M.

As the commercialization of street culture in the 1990s inspired collaborations with fashion and lifestyle brands, Futura's work moved toward a more refined expression of his abstract graffiti style. Commissions from era-defining brands such as A Bathing Ape, St�ssy, Supreme, and Mo' Wax saw his artwork canonized as an elemental component of the street aesthetic.<br><br>Collected here, among never-before-published reproductions of earlier paintings and drawings, is an archive of personal photography and ephemera that reveals how integral Futura has been to the evolution of street art and culture. Guided through more than forty years of work, and with interviews with key players in Futura's career, this is at once a definitive monograph of a legend of contemporary art and an indispensable chapter in the history of graffiti.</p><p><b>Futura</b> is a street artist born and raised in New York. His career began in the 1970s under the moniker Futura 2000; in the decades since, his work has expanded from subway cars into fine art and commercial collaborations with brands from Nike to Supreme, Undercover, and Virgil Abloh. He lives and works in Brooklyn, New York.</p><h2>Textiles of the Arts and Crafts Movement</h2><p>Surveys English textiles created during the Arts and Crafts movement of the late nineteenth century and shows examples of printed and woven textiles, tapestries, carpets, embroideries, and lace</p><p>Linda Parry is a Deputy Keeper at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, where she curated the major William Morris exhibition in 1996.In a delightful and thorough investigation, London's Victoria and Albert Museum staffer Parry recalls the artistic genesis and glory of the Arts and Crafts movement's fabricmakers and their work. The author outlines the history of late 19th century England's textile industry, and shares her understanding of the atmosphere that gave rise to the Arts and Crafts Society 100 years ago. Like the patterns illustrated here, Parry spares no detail in tracing the artists whose work is associated with the movement. While, happily, many lesser-known designers are covered, lengthy analysis is given to C.F.A. Voysey, Lindsay Butterfield and George Haite, whose styles characterize the period. Research dazzles as the Society's exhibitions are recapped and their artistic importance discussed. In a nice touch, we see period photographs of the products in Victorian homes and learn how the public received them. Throughout, Parry displays consummate critical skills while leavening her discourse with enthusiastic appreciation of the fabrics and prints that decorated the Victorian world and now adorn these pages in 50 color plates. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Bleak House (Wordsworth Classics)</h2><p>With an Introduction and Notes by Doreen Roberts, University of Kent at Canterbury Bleak House is one of Dickens&#39; finest achievements, establishing his reputation as a serious and mature novelist, as well as a brilliant comic writer. It is at once a complex mystery story that fully engages the reader in the work of detection, and an unforgettable indictment of an indifferent society. Its representations of a great city&#39;s underworld, and of the law&#39;s corruption and delay, draw upon the author&#39;s personal knowledge and experience. But it is his symbolic art that projects these things in a vision that embraces black comedy, cosmic farce, and tragic ruin. In a unique creative experiment, Dickens divides the narrative between his heroine, Esther Summerson, who is psychologically interesting in her own right, and an unnamed narrator whose perspective both complements and challenges hers.</p><p><i>Bleak House</i> is a satirical look at the Byzantine legal system in London as it consumes the minds and talents of the greedy and nearly destroys the lives of innocents--a contemporary tale indeed. Dickens's tale takes us from the foggy dank streets of London and the maze of the Inns of Court to the peaceful countryside of England. Likewise, the characters run from murderous villains to virtuous girls, from a devoted lover to a "fallen woman," all of whom are affected by a legal suit in which there will, of course, be no winner. The first-person narrative related by the orphan Esther is particularly sweet. The articulate reading by the acclaimed British actor Paul Scofield, whose distinctive broad English accent lends just the right degree of sonority and humor to the text, brings out the color in this classic social commentary disguised as a Victorian drama. However, to abridge Dickens is, well, a Dickensian task, the results of which make for a story in which the author's convoluted plot lines and twists of fate play out in what seems to be a fast-forward format. Listeners must pay close attention in order to keep up with the multiple narratives and cast of curious characters, including the memorable Inspector Bucket and Mr. Guppy. Fortunately, the publisher provides a partial list of characters on the inside jacket. (<i>Running time: 3 hours; 2 cassettes</i>)Founded in 1906 by J.M.

Anchored in the position that people make sense of their worlds through choosing and telling narratives to themselves and others, this text is replete with narratives and stories. Chapters address key aspects of intercultural communication, including verbal and nonverbal communication; stereotypes and bias; identity; conflict; diversity; and ethics. Using an interpretive approach to intercultural communication, the text helps students understand that although a person may appear different, his/her common sense is quite reasonable within a particular interpretive context. Resources are included to help students understand and explain the reasonableness of other cultural systems.</p> <p>The text includes activities for students to complete while reading, including self-assessments and nonverbal self-knowledge tests. Reflection questions within and at the end of each chapter promote thinking and discussion on each topic. With its unique approach to studying intercultural communication via real-life narratives, this text facilitates a deep understanding of the cultural aspects of communication. In providing the narratives of others, it encourages students to tell their own stories and build a strong foundation for communicating across cultures.</p> <p>New to the Third Edition:</p> <ul> <p> </p><li>New chapter&#x2015;"What Role Does Culture Play in Contemporary Contexts?"&#x2015;explores intercultural communication as it relates to the environment, health, and technology. </li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>New sections on identity, silence, and terms of address as important communicative practices in intercultural settings. </li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>Updated sections on honorifics, key terms, social dramas and the golden approaches to ethics.</li></ul></p><p><p><strong>Bradford J.

Patch Adams --Patch Adams</p><h2>House by the Churchyard (Tales of Mystery &amp; the Supernatural)</h2><p>Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu is best known today as one of the Victorian period s leading exponents of supernatural fiction, and was described by M.R. James as standing absolutely in the first rank as a writer of ghost stories. <br> The House by the Churchyard is perhaps his best novel in this genre. Set in the village of Chapelizod, near Dublin, in the 1760s the story opens with the accidental disinterment of an old skull in the churchyard, and an eerie late-night funeral. This discovery relates to murders, both recent and historical whose repercussions disrupt the complacent pace of village affairs and change the lives of many of its notable characters forever. Charm and chilling darkness abound in equal measure in one of the greatest novels of a Victorian master of mystery.</p><p>An internationally recognized expert on Sherlock Holmes and Conan Doyle, David Stuart Davies is the editor of the crime fiction magazine &#34;Sherlock&#34; and the author of several books on Sherlock Holmes.

Rockefeller, founded Standard Oil and used his fortune to create the modern state of Florida. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Chandler (Criminal Brotherhood, etc.) provides colorful accounts of the early immigrants and the ferment of invention and industry of the mid- and late-1880s to which the Standard Oil empire contributed. After an initial visit to Jacksonville in 1877 because of his first wife's health, Flagler disengaged from the company and at 64 started a second career in Florida as developer of farmland and resort areas, building luxury hotels and railroads which spurred the growth of Fort Lauderdale, Miami, Palm Beach and other cities. Flagler, an elusive personality, remains an enigmatic figure, however, despite his astonishing life as a visionary robber baron recreated here. Photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.In this biography of Flagler (1830-1913), co-founder of Standard Oil with John D. Rockefeller and pioneer in the development of Florida, Chandler provides well-written, more detailed information than has previously been available on Flagler's early years from ages 15 to 40 and on the fate of his Palm Beach house, Whitehall. But while Chandler has done original research in primary sources, he has a disturbing tendency to quote materialat times without citationfrom Sidney Walter Martin's seminal work, Florida's Flagler (1949). Overall, this biography closely resembles Martin's in approach and content. It reads more like a second revised edition than a new book and does little more to illuminate Flagler's motivations or character. Not recommended. Susan Hamburger , Florida State Univ.

Coverage emphasizes the balance between experiment and theory. It places stress on the phenomenological approach and basic theoretical concepts rather than rigorous mathematical detail. Donald Perkins also details recent developments in elementary particle physics, as well as its connections with cosmology and astrophysics. A number of key experiments are also identified along with a description of how they have influenced the field. Perkins presents most of the material in the context of the Standard Model of quarks and leptons. He also fully explores the shortcomings of this model and new physics beyond its compass (such as supersymmetry, neutrino mass and oscillations, GUTs and superstrings). The text includes many problems and a detailed and annotated further reading list. The volume will also provide a solid foundation for graduate study.</p><p>The 4th edition of a textbook that has dominated advanced undergraduate and graduate particle physics teaching for the last 25 years. The author is a senior figure of modern day particle physics and brings a unique authority and depth of understanding to the subject. The new edition has been extensively rewritten and completely updated. Completely new chapters have been added to cover the burgeoning field connecting particle physics with cosmology, and another new chapter introduces exciting new topics such as supersymmetry, superstrings, neutrino masses and grand unified theories.fm.author_biographical_note1</p><h2>Cultural Misunderstandings: The French-American Experience</h2><p>Raymonde Carroll presents an intriguing and thoughtful analysis of the many ways French and Americans&#x2014;and indeed any members of different cultures&#x2014;can misinterpret each other, even when ostensibly speaking the same language. Cultural misunderstandings, Carroll points out, can arise even where we least expect them&#x2014;in our closest relationships. The revealing vignettes that Carroll relates, and her perceptive comments, bring to light some fundamental differences in French and American presuppositions about love, friendship, and raising children, as well as such everyday activities as using the telephone or asking for information. <br></p><p>Text: English, French (translation)Volk's translation evokes the flavor of Carroll's French in an entertaining, informative book. The author is a U.S. citizen of French origin, an anthropologist and teacher at Oberlin College, who lived on a Micronesian island and wrote Nokoru Stories , about social customs there. Her inter-cultural experiences form the text of this illustrative, often witty book about why the French and the Americanseven when fluent in both languagescan confound each other with what seems uncivil behavior. Carroll explains cultural misunderstandings on such diverse areas as party manners, child-rearing, privacy, using the telephone and, most important, friendship. The examples are eye-opening and all-encompassing, a vital source for learning how to establish amity not only between the U.S. and France but among all the world's nations. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</h2><p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td>A brilliant book which studies the psychological conditions which made possible the development of capitalist civilization.

They have destroyed cities and ended civilizations. John Dvorak, the acclaimed author of Earthquake Storms, looks into the early scientific study of volcanoes and the life of the man who pioneered the field, Thomas Jaggar.</p><p>Educated at Harvard, Jaggar went to the Caribbean after Mount Pelee exploded in 1902, killing more than 26,000 people. Witnessing the destruction and learning about the horrible deaths these people had suffered, Jaggar vowed to dedicate himself to a study of volcanoes. What followed was fifty years of global travel to eruptions in Italy, Alaska, Central America, Japan and the Pacific.</p><p>In 1912, he built a small science station at the edge of a lake of molten lava at Kilauea volcano in the Hawaiian Islands, with the goal of solving the mystery of why volcanoes erupt and how they could be predicted. Jaggar found something else at Kilauea: true love.</p><p>She was Isabel Maydwell, a widowed school teacher who came to Kilauea to restart her life. For more than twenty ears, she and Jaggar ran the science station, living in a small house at the edge of a high cliff that overlooked the lava lake. Maydwell would quickly becoming one of the world&#x2019;s most astute observers of volcanic activity.</p><p>Mixed with tales of myths and rituals, as well as the author&#x2019;s own experiences and insight into volcanic activity, <em>The Last Volcano</em> reveals the lure and romance of confronting nature in its most magnificent form&#x2015;the edge of a volcanic eruption.</p> 8 page B&amp;W image insert</p><p>Originally trained as a lunar scientist, John Dvorak, PhD, spent twenty years operating a large telescope at Mauna Kea for the Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawaii.&nbsp; His writing has appeared as cover stories for Scientific American, Astronomy and Physics Today.&nbsp; His books include Earthquake Storms and The Last Volcano, both available from Pegasus Books.&#x201c;A lively biography of the forgotten father of volcanology.

This urban biography provides an entirely new vision of the city's history, laying bare the inner dynamics of the regional civilization centered in San Francisco. <i>Imperial San Francisco</i> examines the far-reaching environmental impact that one city and the elite families that hold power in it have had on the Pacific Basin for over a century and a half. The book provides a literate, myth-shattering interpretation of the hidden costs that the growth of San Francisco has exacted on its surrounding regions, presenting along the way a revolutionary new theory of urban development. Written in a lively, accessible style, the narrative is filled with vivid characters, engrossing stories, and a rich variety of illustrations.<br><br>As he uncovers the true costs of building an imperial city, Gray Brechin addresses the dynastic ambitions of frontier oligarchies, the environmental and social effects of the mining industry, the creation of two universities, the choice of imperial architecture to symbolize the aspirations of San Franciscans in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, manipulation of public thought by the city's media, and more. He traces the exploitation of both local and distant regions by prominent families&#x2014;the Hearsts, de Youngs, Spreckelses, and others&#x2014;who gained wealth and power through mining, control of ranching, water and energy, transportation, real estate, and weapons.<br><br>This broad history of San Francisco is a story of greed and ambition on an epic scale. <i>Imperial San Francisco</i> incorporates rare period illustrations, personal correspondence, and public statements to show how a little-known power elite has used the city as a tool to increase its own wealth and power.

He published twenty-four books, including works of fiction, history, and journalism. <br><b>Patrick Chura</b> is an associate professor of English at the University of Akron, Ohio."Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x2019;s <i>Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Cabin,</i> Frank Norris&#x2019;s <i>The Octopus</i> and John Steinbeck&#x2019;s <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> are still readable and powerful enough to move the reader, but most other examples of American protest fiction must be soldiered through. To the small company of exceptions should be added <i>The Harbor</i> itself, by Ernest Poole, which Penguin Classics has rescued from oblivion." &#x2014; <b>Dennis Drabelle, <i>Washington Post Book World</i></b></p><h2>Everyday Things in Premodern Japan: The Hidden Legacy of Material Culture</h2><p>Japan was the only non-Western nation to industrialize before 1900 and its leap into the modern era has stimulated vigorous debates among historians and social scientists. In an innovative discussion that posits the importance of physical well-being as a key indicator of living standards, Susan B. Hanley considers daily life in the three centuries leading up to the modern era in Japan. She concludes that people lived much better than has been previously understood&#x2015;at levels equal or superior to their Western contemporaries. She goes on to illustrate how this high level of physical well-being had important consequences for Japan's ability to industrialize rapidly and for the comparatively smooth transition to a modern, industrial society.<br><br>While others have used income levels to conclude that the Japanese household was relatively poor in those centuries, Hanley examines the material culture&#x2015;food, sanitation, housing, and transportation. How did ordinary people conserve the limited resources available in this small island country? What foods made up the daily diet and how were they prepared? How were human wastes disposed of? How long did people live? Hanley answers all these questions and more in an accessible style and with frequent comparisons with Western lifestyles. Her methods allow for cross-cultural comparisons between Japan and the West as well as Japan and the rest of Asia. They will be useful to anyone interested in the effects of modernization on daily life.</p><p>"A wonderfully original, cogently argued, and very readable book. Hanley provides persuasive answers to some of the largest questions historians have been asking about the relationship of premodern social and economic conditions to the modern development of Japan."&#x2015;Stephen Vlastos, author of <i>Peasant Protests and Uprisings in Tokugawa Japan</i><b>Susan B.

The purpose of each meditation is to guide readers into a deeper understanding of his or her self, as well as the world in which we live.</p><p>In the introduction to the book, don Miguel Ruiz Jr. reminds readers that progress on the Toltec path is not measured by the acquisition of things, status, or even ideas, but rather the complete and total realization that everything in the world is perfect, exactly the way it is at this moment.</p><p>"Love is accepting ourselves just the way we are, with all of our flaws and our ever-changing belief system. You are nothing else but who you are. You are not the person you were a year ago. You are not the person you will be in a year. You aren't even the person you think you are. You simply are, and that must be enough." --don Miguel Ruiz Jr.</p><p>This book will have special appeal to those already familiar with his father's books <i>The Four Agreements, The Mastery of Love</i>, and <i>The Fifth Agreement</i>, as well as don Miguel Ruiz Jr.'s own book, <i>The Five Levels of Attachment</i>. It also makes a wonderful gift.</p></p><p><b>don Miguel Ruiz, Jr.</b>, is a Nagual, or a Toltec Master of Transformation. He is a direct descendant of the Toltecs of the Eagle Knight lineage, and is the son of don Miguel Ruiz, Sr., author of <i>The Four Agreements</i>. He lives in Sacramento, California, with his wife and two children. www.miguelruiz.com/index.php?p=MiguelJr"Whether he's talking about Letting Go of Perfection, Following Your Heart, Taking Off the Mask, or Living Your Life as a Work of Art, don Miguel Ruiz's son speaks from the heritage of Toltec wisdom that was passed on to him by his grandmother and his father. He not only learned the lessons well, he has made them his own. In this book of short lessons and meditations he puts the wisdom into his own heart-felt words in a way that truly brings them into daily life. The message of the book -- that everything in life is interconnected and is perfect in the moment -- is very similar to that of Buddhist mindfulness practice. There is an earthy quality in the way Ruiz expresses those ideas that makes this book of daily meditations particularly comforting." -<b>Anna Jedrziewski</b>, <i>Retailing Insight</i>, December 2013</p><h2>Peterson First Guide To Mammals Of North America</h2><p>Peterson First Guides are the first books the beginning naturalist needs.

Declaring sexual drives to be fundamentally irrepressible and blameless, she challenged the Platonic and religious orthodoxy of her time, which condemned all forms of sensual experience, denied the rationality of women, and relegated femininity to the realm of physicality and sin. Human beings, she argued, consist of body and soul, sense and intellect, and honorable love must be based on this real nature.<br> <br> By exposing the intrinsic misogyny of prevailing theories of love, Aragona vindicates all women, proposing a morality of love that restores them to intellectual and sexual parity with men.

This volume celebrates the vivid historical imagery produced during these years by bringing together some of the finest masterpieces of illumination created in the Middle Ages. It is the first major publication to focus on exploring the ways in which text and illumination worked together to help show medieval readers the role and purpose of history. The images enabled the past to come alive before the eyes of medieval readers by relating the adventures of epic figures such as Hector of Troy, Alexander the Great, the Holy Roman Emperor Charlemagne, and even the Virgin Mary.</p><p>Presented here are approximately fifty-five manuscripts from over twenty-five libraries and museums across the United States and Europe, supplemented by medieval objects ranging from tapestries to ivory boxes. Together they show how historical narratives came to play a decisive role at the French court and in the process inspired some of the most original and splendid artworks of the time.

Ten chapters look at the archaeology of the druids, celtic practices, the classical literature, sacrifices, prophecy, female druids in celtic society, sacred places and priests, druids in Irish mythology, the 18th and 19th century revivals, and modern beliefs. The bibliography is accompanied by a directory of modern druid organizations.</p><p>Miranda Green is a leading scholar of Celtic studies whose previous books include Dictionary of Celtic Myth and Legend.In this copiously illustrated book, Green (Dictionary of Celtic Myth and Legend, LJ 3/1/92) discusses the Druids in depth. She begins by analyzing the classical writings on Druids. She also discusses the role of historical and archaeological analysis, showing how little is known and how scholarly inquiry may or may not arrive at the truth, particularly since the Druids based their learning and training on memorization and the oral tradition. The author examines the archaeological finds and the conclusions drawn from that. She discusses the Druid resurgence in the 19th century and the Druids' role in the 20th-century neopagan movement. Well written, thoughtful, and thought-provoking, this work would make an excellent companion to John Matthews's The Druid Source Book (Sterling, 1996).

Combining a first-hand knowledge of the sea and transatlantic travel with a brilliantly readable narrative style, he produced what has become nothing less than the definitive account of the great age of European exploration. In his riveting and richly illustrated saga, Morison offers a comprehensive account of all the known voyages by Europeans to the New World from 500 A.D. to the seventeenth century. Together, the two volumes of The European Discovery of America tell the compelling stories of the many intrepid explorers who made what was then a journey frought with danger-figures as diverse as Leif Ericsson, Columbus, John Cabot, Jacques Cartier, Martin Frobisher, Magellan, Sir Walter Raleigh, and Sir Francis Drake to name but a few. They also follow the adventures of lesser-known but no less interesting mariners and offer a detailed look at those who set them forth on their travels. In the first volume, The Northern Voyages-winner of the prestigious Bancroft Prize for History-Morison re-creates the lives and perilous times of those who claimed to have seen the shores of North America in the 600 years after the Norsemen first landed. He brings to his account a rare immediacy, making the drama and unpredictability of their voyages as significant in relation to the people of their era as the astronauts&#39; journeys have been for our own times. Morison also offers a fascinating look at the imaginary lands reported by early travelers (such mythical places as Antilia and the Seven Cities, the glorious Kingdoms of Norumbega and Saguenay, and Hy-Brasil the Isle of the Blest) and examines as well the alleged discoverers of these lands. With warmth and wit he distinguishes fact from fiction, and imaginary explorers and their exploits from actual men and events. In the second volume, Morison turns his attention to the naviga</p><p>The late Samuel Eliot Morison, twice winner of the Pulitzer Prize, was the author of numerous books including The Oxford History of the American People, The Growth of the American Republic, and Admiral of the Ocean, a biography of Columbus."Exuberant....Plenty of meticulous research and inspired labor went into this true and exciting yarn of the early European voyages to America. But there's more than that. He has added to his research by physically retacing many of the explorers' routes, gaining his descriptive color<br>firsthand. He offers a hearty fare mixed with oakum, salt spray and sea biscuit."--The Christian Science Monitor<br><br>"Now [Morison] has united the latest findings of modern scholarship, American and European, to his own zestful explorations by land, sea and air, to produce a comprehensive and, for our day and age, definitive account of the process by which Europe substituted fact for fable and knowledge for<br>ignorance about the New World across the Western Ocean....[A] unique combination of scholarship and fieldwork....Into these volumes is distilled a lifetime of experience--of sailing, of learning and of the sadly neglected art of historical narration. They are a joy and a treasure<br>house."--Economist</p><h2>The Clipper Ship Strategy: For Success in Your Career, Business and Investments (An &#34;Uncle Eric&#34; Book)</h2><p>The Clipper Ship Strategy: For Success in Your Career, Business and Investmen...</p><p>Richard Maybury, also known as Uncle Eric, is a world renowned author, lecturer, and geopolitical analyst. He consults with business firms in the U.S. and Europe. Mr. Maybury is the former Global Affairs editor of &#34;Moneyworld&#34; and widely regarded as one of the finest free-market writers in America. Mr. Maybury&#39;s articles have appeared in &#34;The Wall Street Journal&#34;, &#34;USA Today&#34;, and other major publications. He has penned eleven books in the Uncle Eric series. His books have been endorsed by top business leaders, including former U.S. Treasury Secretary William Simon, and he has been interviewed on more than 250 radio and TV shows across America."Richard Maybury's..."The Clipper Ship Strategy', is an outstanding addition to his series dealing with the subjects of economics, law, politics, business and freedom. His extraordinary ability to present complex subjects in simple, common-sense terms, spiced with humor and fascinating examples, makes this book and the others in the series must reading for both the young and adults, alike. In fact, the entire series should be a required, integral, component of the social studies curriculum in all public and private schools. This would bring a quantum leap upward in the quality of citizenship in this country in a single generation." --William P. Snavely, Emeritus Professor of Economics, George Mason University<br><br>"While Maybury's 'lessons' are valuable for everyone, I especially recommend this book to potential entrepreneurs and businessmen. I would make it required reading for them if I could.

Science should be on our daily conversation menu, along with topics like politics, books, sports, or the latest prestige cable drama. Conversations about science, he tells us, shouldn't be left to the experts. In <i>The Dialogues</i>, Johnson invites us to eavesdrop on a series of nine conversations, in graphic-novel form&#x2015;written and drawn by Johnson&#x2015;about &#x201c;the nature of the universe.&#x201d; The conversations take place all over the world, in museums, on trains, in restaurants, in what may or may not be Freud's favorite coffeehouse. The conversationalists are men, women, children, experts, and amateur science buffs. The topics of their conversations range from the science of cooking to the multiverse and string theory. The graphic form is especially suited for physics; one drawing can show what it would take many words to explain.</p><p>In the first conversation, a couple meets at a costume party; they speculate about a scientist with superhero powers who doesn't use them to fight crime but to do more science, and they discuss what it means to have a &#x201c;beautiful equation&#x201d; in science. Their conversation spills into another chapter (&#x201c;Hold on, you haven't told me about light yet&#x201d;), and in a third chapter they exchange phone numbers. Another couple meets on a train and discusses immortality, time, black holes, and religion. A brother and sister experiment with a grain of rice. Two women sit in a sunny courtyard and discuss the multiverse, quantum gravity, and the anthropic principle. After reading these conversations, we are ready to start our own.</p></p><p>"This is a fantastic book--entertaining, informative, enjoyable, and thought-provoking."&nbsp;--A. Zee, Kavil Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of California, Santa Barbara; author of&nbsp;Fearful Symmetry&nbsp;and&nbsp;Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell<br><br>"Two superheroes walk into a natural history museum--what happens after that will have you thinking and talking for a long time to come.&nbsp;Clifford V. Johnson's&nbsp;<i>The Dialogues</i>&nbsp;joins a select few examples of recent texts, such as Scott McCloud's&nbsp;<i>Understanding Comics</i>, Larry Gonick's&nbsp;<i>Cartoon History of the Universe</i>, Nick Sousanis's&nbsp;<i>Unflattening</i>, Bryan Talbot's&nbsp;<i>Alice in Sunderland</i>, or Joe Sacco's&nbsp;<i>Palestine</i>, which use the affordances of graphic storytelling as pedagogical tools for changing the ways we think about the world around us.&nbsp;&nbsp;Johnson displays a solid grasp of the craft of comics, demonstrating how this medium can be used to represent different understandings of the relationship between time and space, questions central to his native eld of physics. He takes advantage of the observational qualities of contemporary graphic novels to explore the place of scientific thinking in our everyday lives."&nbsp;--Henry Jenkins, Media Scholar, University of Southern California, author of Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide<br><br>"The Dialogues&nbsp;is everything I would have loved as a teen physics nerd, and exactly what I want the public-- and my fellow scientists--reading now that I'm a professional physics nerd.&nbsp;The Dialogues&nbsp;successfully upends tired traditions in science writing, which all too often rely on outdated tropes about what science is, what scientists look like, and what we can trust the public to understand."&nbsp;--Chanda Prescod-Weinstein, theoretical physicist, activist, and writer, recipient of the 2017 lgbt+physicists Acknowledgement of Excellence AwardClifford V. Johnson, Professor of Physics at the University of Southern California, gives many public lectures about his research and appears often in television documentaries as an expert. He has been science advisor for several movies and television series, including Marvel's <i>Thor: Ragnarok </i>and the National Geographic Channel's <i>Genius</i>. He received the American Association of Physics Teachers 2018 Klopsteg Memorial Award for&nbsp;outstanding&nbsp;communication of the excitement of contemporary physics to the general public.</p><h2>Feminist Contentions: A Philosophical Exchange (Thinking Gender)</h2><p>First published in 1995.

The defendants were falsely charged with treason and espionage because of their involvement in the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee, and because of their heartfelt response as Jews to Nazi atrocities on occupied Soviet territory. Stalin had created the committee to rally support for the Soviet Union during World War II, but he then disbanded it after the war as his paranoia mounted about Soviet Jews. <br>For many years, a host of myths surrounded the case against the committee. Now this book, which presents an abridged version of the long-suppressed transcript of the trial, reveals the Kremlin&#x2019;s machinery of destruction. Joshua Rubenstein provides annotations about the players and events surrounding the case. In a long introduction, drawing on newly released documents in Moscow archives and on interviews with relatives of the defendants in Israel, Russia, and the United States, Rubenstein also sets the trial in historical and political context and offers a vivid account of Stalin&#x2019;s anti-Semitic campaign.</p><p><b>Joshua Rubenstein</b> is the Northeast Regional Director of Amnesty International USA and a longtime associate of the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies, Harvard University. <b>Vladmir P.

But at almost fifteen, Anne and Gilbert's youngest daughter, Rilla, dreams only of her first dance and getting her first kiss from the dashing Kenneth Ford. Soon, however, even far-off Ingleside is engulfed by Europe's raging conflict, as Rilla's brothers Jem and Walter both enlist, and Rilla finds herself caring for an orphaned newborn.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the conflict spreads, the Blythes wait anxiously for word of their absent sons, and a bad omen leads them to conclude that something terrible has happened overseas. Have Jem and Walter been lost, like so many valiant young men before them? And what of Kenneth Ford?

Readers who ignore all the "Do not open" signs get what they deserve. You can practically hear Vincent Price reading the rhymed texts. The Door Under the Stairs leads to Dr. Frankenstein's lab, where he and his sinister friends wait: "For you see, his new monster is missing some bits . . . / And they're all pretty sure YOU have something that fits!" Dracula has left Some Bodies in the Attic , and now " he seeks red-blooded friends for a small drink or two . . . / And he's very certain that he'd like to meet YOU!" In both books a gloriously hideous face leers out from the last spread. Special effects are inventive and well designed, not quite as elaborate as those in Pienkowski's Haunted House (Dutton , 1979), but not quite as fragile either. Ghoulish fun for story time or display. --John Peters, New York Public Library<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.In the best Halloween tradition, these Spooky Pop-up books will give young readers pleasurable creepy-crawlies. Dracula and his buddies search for "red-blooded friends for a small drink or two" in Some Bodies in the Attic , and the mad scientist Doctor Frankenstein looks for "a fresh body like you" in The Door Under the Stairs . The visual effects are outstanding: giant bats and spiders dramatically lunge at the unsuspecting turner of these pages; lifting the tantalizing panels marked "Do Not Open" produces such spine-tinglers as a monster popping out of a coffin, a skull appearing in a window and a ghost in full scream; and pull tags remove characters' heads and take a mummy for a spin. It's all great scary fun to celebrate the witching season.

Ultimately denounced as heretical by the early church, Gnosticism proposed a revealed knowledge of God ("gnosis" meaning "knowledge" in Greek), held as a secret tradition of the apostles. In <i>The Gnostic Gospels</i>, author Elaine Pagels suggests that Christianity could have developed quite differently if Gnostic texts had become part of the Christian canon. Without a doubt: Gnosticism celebrates God as both Mother and Father, shows a very human Jesus's relationship to Mary Magdalene, suggests the Resurrection is better understood symbolically, and speaks to self-knowledge as the route to union with God. Pagels argues that Christian orthodoxy grew out of the political considerations of the day, serving to legitimize and consolidate early church leadership. Her contrast of that developing orthodoxy with Gnostic teachings presents an intriguing trajectory on a world faith as it "might have become." <i>The Gnostic Gospels</i> provides engaging reading for those seeking a broader perspective on the early development of Christianity. <i>--F.

Muckle</b> is Professor of Anthropology at Capilano University. <br>Bob Muckle's <em>Introducing Archaeology</em> is a comprehensive overview of the discipline that is written with attention to student interests and needs. The book's content is balanced effectively between the nature of archaeological practice and the processes and products of archaeological interpretation. Students will come away with a sense of disciplinary history, an understanding of core issues of archaeological interest, and an appreciation for the social contexts of contemporary archaeological practice. (Jane Baxter, DePaul University)<br><br>In this intelligent, very readable text, Muckle exposes students to a subject that is likely very different from what they imagine. Whether it's an archaeology of five minutes ago, or thousands of years distant, he clearly explains how archaeologists think, all the while managing to keep the 'romance' intact. (Larry J. Zimmerman, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis)<br><br>Comprehensive, practical, modern, and humorous: Muckle has written a textbook that conveys all of the excitement, uncertainty, and deep insight that accompanies that wonderful and complicated thing we call archaeology. This is the perfect example of how archaeology can be presented to students in <br><br>an accessible and inviting way while maintaining intellectual integrity. (Jason De Leon, University of Michigan)<br><br>The writing style and reasonable price are enough to recommend the book, but I use this text in my first-year class because, unlike most introductory texts, it emphasizes the social context of archaeology. Muckle explores the discipline's ethical responsibilities, shows how archaeology is influenced by and can influence contemporary politics, and documents the many ways in which a critically engaged archaeology can make a positive social contribution in the present. This aspect of the book has been expanded in the final chapter of the second edition and cements <em>Introducing Archaeology</em> as my 'go to' text for first-year teaching.

He rose to prominence in Rome, pursuing a career in the courts and political life, for which he had been trained, while also acquiring celebrity as an author of tragedies and essays. Falling foul of successive emperors (Caligula in AD 39 and Claudius in AD 41), he spent eight years in exile, allegedly for an affair with Caligula&#x2019;s sister. Recalled in AD 49, he was made praetor and was appointed tutor to the boy who was to become, in AD 54, the emperor Nero. On Nero&#x2019;s succession, Seneca acted for some eight years as an unofficial chief minister. The early part of this reign was remembered as a period of sound government, for which the main credit seems due to Seneca. His control over Nero declined as enemies turned the emperor against him with representations that his popularity made him a danger, or with accusations of immorality or excessive wealth. Retiring from public life he devoted his last three years to philosophy and writing, particularly the <i>Letters to Lucilius.</i> In AD 65 following the discovery of a plot against the emperor, in which he was thought to be implicated, he and many others were compelled by Nero to commit suicide. His fame as an essayist and dramatist lasted until two or three centuries ago, when he passed into literary oblivion, from which the twentieth century has seen a considerable recovery.<br><br><b>William Arrowsmith</b>&nbsp;was an American classicist, academic, and translator.&nbsp;His translations include works by Euripides, Aristophanes<i>, </i>and Petronius.<i> </i>He died in 1992."This version by a translator who understands the high art of low humor is conspicuously funny."<br> &#x2014;<b>Time</b><p>"William Arrowsmith's translation of <b>The Satyricon</b> meets the two fundamental requirements of the translator's art: perfect fidelity to the original and a vitality of style that tempts the reader to believe that the English version is not a translation....

Hardly a black or Hispanic face could be seen as the gray-suited, gray-haired businessmen--some leaning on walkers, others spry and ruddy-faced, with athletic builds honed on Harvard crew or tennis teams--and women in silk scarves and slimming black pants made their way through an unmarked door into Annenberg Hall. There was no campus announcement of the gathering, and no press coverage allowed. Bouquets of forsythia and tulips decked out the usually spartan freshman dining hall. The visitors enjoyed cocktails, wine, and appetizers--beef tenderloin, crab cakes, asparagus spears--as well as the attentions of Lawrence Summers, then Harvard&#39;s president. Several guests chatted about the latest show by the Hasty Pudding Club, the student theatrical society that puts on a musical burlesque every spring featuring Harvard men in drag. Then the Harvard band, perched in a balcony overhead, struck up &#34;Ten Thousand Men of Harvard,&#34; and the group sat down to a candlelit dinner. Wine refills put the crowd in an expansive mood, and they frequently interrupted Summers&#39;s after-dinner speech with applause. The sole exception was when he outlined his initiative to boost enrollment of students from families earning less than $40,000 a year by making their Harvard educations free. He appeared to wait for an ovation that never came. I interpreted the awkward silence to convey a message, perhaps even a threat: If you make room for more low-income students by rejecting our children, we&#39;ll stop giving our millions. The April 8 dinner kicked off the 2005 annual meeting of what is likely the wealthiest advisory group in higher education: Harvard&#39;s Committee on University Resources. Little known and rarely mentioned in the media, COUR is not actually a committee in the usual sense--it doesn&#39;t formally make or advise on university policy--but Summers or any other Harvard president needs its support. It consists of Harvard&#39;s biggest donors, who form the financial backbone of an endowment that totaled $25.5 billion as of fiscal 2005, making it the nation&#39;s largest, more than $10 billion ahead of second-place Yale&#39;s. Committee membership has tripled in the past fifteen years, propelled by the university&#39;s record-setting $2.6 billion fund-raising campaign, which lasted from 1994 to 1999 and relied heavily on multimillion-dollar gifts. &#34;As a member of COUR, you will be asked to play a leading role in the proposed campaign,&#34; committee chairman Robert G. Stone Jr. told members in 1991 in the first issue of its newsletter. By 2004, COUR&#39;s 424 members, handpicked by university fund-raisers, included ten of Forbes magazine&#39;s four hundred richest Americans, led by Microsoft chief executive Steven Ballmer (2005 net worth: $14 billion), oil tycoon Robert Bass ($3 billion), and banker David Rockefeller ($2.5 billion). Most are alumni of Harvard&#39;s undergraduate college or its graduate programs, but not all; Bass, for instance, went to archrival Yale, followed by business school at Stanford. To qualify for membership, donors must generally have given at least $1 million to Harvard--or be expected to do so--although a few smaller donors were picked for their prowess in raising large sums from wealthy classmates and business associates on Harvard&#39;s behalf. The seventy-three members of the group&#39;s inner circle, the executive committee, have typically given or raised at least $5 million, and sometimes much more. A free dinner and a newsletter aren&#39;t the only signs of Harvard&#39;s gratitude to COUR members. The school summons top faculty to the committee&#39;s annual meeting to expound on such topics as nanotechnology and the science of aging. It names athletic facilities, research centers, faculty chairs, fellowships, and scholarships after donors. And, in the most valuable reward of all, Harvard gives a massive admissions edge to their children, who flourish in a selection process that lacks conflict-of-interest rules and systematically favors the wealthy and well-connected. Although Harvard bridles at any suggestion that its slots are for sale, I found numerous instances in which a child&#39;s acceptance closely preceded or followed a major gift from the parents, giving at least the appearance of a quid pro quo. Most notably, a politically connected New Jersey real estate mogul with no Harvard ties pledged $2.5 million to the university only months before his elder son--a student below Harvard&#39;s usual standards--was admitted. Harvard admits fewer than one in ten undergraduate applicants, turning down more than half of candidates with perfect SAT scores. Nine-tenths of its freshman ranked in the top 10 percent of their high school classes. Its graduate and professional schools boast similarly high standards: Harvard law school, for instance, accepts only 11 percent of applicants. Children of major donors enjoy far better odds. By examining Who&#39;s Who entries, alumni records, and other sources, I found that 218 of 424 COUR members, or more than half, have had at least one child at Harvard. Many donors send more than one child to Harvard, bringing the total number of COUR members&#39; offspring who have enrolled there over the years to at least 336. Nearly three hundred of these children attended Harvard as undergraduates, with most of the rest attending the law and business schools, which provide an entree into the corridors of American power. Since, by my count, at least eighty COUR members either do not have children or their children have not reached college age, the number of COUR offspring who have gone to Harvard works out to 336 children of about 340 eligible members--an astonishing enrollment rate of one child per major donor. Given that the typical married couple in the United States has one or two children, that wealthy women tend to have fewer children than the average, and that many children of COUR members never apply to Harvard at all, a conservative conclusion would be that the university welcomes well over half of applicants from the families of its biggest donors. Through their easy access to Harvard, the children of COUR members don&#39;t just gain intellectual polish. They also acquire a prestigious career credential and high-powered friends and spouses, consolidating their families&#39; place in the American aristocracy. &#34;Last year we completed a double &#39;hat trick&#39; when my youngest daughter, Morgan, married Harvard classmate John Stafford,&#34; investment banker Ralph Hellmold, a member of the Committee on University Resources, boasted to his Harvard classmates on their fortieth reunion in 2002. &#34;Thus, each of my three daughters has not only graduated from the college, but married her own Harvard man.&#34; Executive committee member James O. Welch Jr., former vice chairman of RJR Nabisco Inc. and a Harvard alumnus who endowed a professorship in computer science, leads the way in the admissions sweepstakes, with six sons who graduated from Harvard. Welch declined comment. Similarly, Finn M. W. Caspersen&#39;s generosity has not gone unrewarded in admissions to Harvard Law, a school whose preference for children of well-heeled alumni was satirized in Legally Blonde. The heroine of the hit 2001 comedy, played by Reese Witherspoon, learns from a classmate that her dim-witted ex-boyfriend, Warner Huntington III, &#34;got wait-listed when he applied. His father had to make a call.&#34; Caspersen, a Harvard Law alumnus who also sits on the COUR executive committee, formerly headed consumer lending giant Beneficial Corp., which specializes in making high-interest loans to consumers with poor credit. He and his wife have endowed several faculty chairs at the law school and donated to its library, where the rare-book room is named after them. Caspersen, who now runs a private investment firm, chairs a $400 million fund-raising campaign that the law school launched in 2003. Four Caspersen children--Finn junior (who also has a Harvard bachelor&#39;s degree), Erik, Samuel, and Andrew--have enrolled at Harvard Law. The Caspersens declined comment. Professor David R. Herwitz, who served for years on the law school&#39;s admissions committee, told me that Caspersen&#39;s sons were fine students and &#34;totally admissible.&#34; He added, &#34;Any school, particularly one with a long tradition, becomes something of a family. What kind of a crazy world would it be if people who had gone to the school and made contributions would be told: your kid is very close, but not close enough?&#34; Undoubtedly some children of COUR members were superb candidates whom Harvard might have admitted even if they were unhooked. For others, the preferences of privilege outweighed test scores or grades below Harvard norms. These fortunate candidates with marginal credentials--like many minorities aided by affirmative action--are often saddled with self-doubt, wondering if they deserved their Harvard admission. Most COUR children at Harvard have been legacies--a group to which Harvard acknowledges giving at least a small admissions boost. Harvard accepts one third of alumni children, nearly four times its overall admission rate. Legacies constitute 13 percent of the student body. William Fitzsimmons, dean of admissions and financial aid at Harvard, who has been a guest speaker at COUR meetings, told me that he personally reads all applications from alumni children. He said the average SAT score of legacies admitted to Harvard falls just a couple of points below the school&#39;s overall average, and that he uses legacy status as a tie-breaker between comparable candidates. Asked how he defends a policy so little rooted in merit, Fitzsimmons, a 1967 Harvard graduate, said the school&#39;s alumni &#34;volunteer an immense amount of their free time in recruiting students, raising money for their financial aid, taking part in Harvard Club activities at the local level, and in general promoting the college.&#34; He added, &#34;They often bring a special kind of loyalty and enthusiasm for life at the college that makes a real difference in the college climate . . . and makes Harvard a happier place.&#34; Therefore, he said, &#34;when their sons and daughters apply, we review their applications with great care and will give a &#39;tip&#39; in the admissions process to them.&#34; Loyalty and volunteerism aside, the biggest reason for Harvard&#39;s legacy preference is money. Alumni donations drive Harvard&#39;s endowment, and the ability and willingness of graduates to donate to the university influence the size of the preference given to their progeny. The better than one-in-two admission rate for COUR members&#39; children in my survey indicates that children of big alumni donors enjoy more than the tie-breaker edge Fitzsimmons describes. This finding corroborates a 1991 study by David Karen, now a professor at Bryn Mawr College, which concluded that alumni children at Harvard lose most of their admissions advantage if they apply for financial aid. In other words, if alumni want their children to have an admissions edge at Harvard, they should become bankers, lawyers, or dentists--not social workers, teachers, or ministers. &#34;My interpretation was that if you couldn&#39;t parlay a Harvard degree into an income sufficient to pay for your kid&#39;s education, Harvard was less likely to make the same mistake twice,&#34; Professor Karen told me. The boost for children of alumni on the University Resources committee can amount to far more than a couple of SAT points. Harvard alumnus and Boston venture capitalist Craig L. Burr, a member of the Committee on University Resources, gave his alma mater at least $1 million in the mid 1990s; his son, Matthew, applied in 1998. Matthew Burr ranked fourth in his class at the Groton School but had an SAT score of 1240. Three-fourths of Harvard students have SAT scores of 1380 or higher, and the average freshman score is about 1470. Matthew applied to one other college, Williams, which rejected him. &#34;I just don&#39;t test well,&#34; Matthew told me. He wrote an application essay about a family safari to Kenya--a likely tip-off, if one were needed, of the Burrs&#39; wealth to admissions readers. His Groton counselor, he said, made it clear to him that his family connection would &#34;help out&#34; with Harvard admissions. Craig Burr told me his donation to Harvard had &#34;absolutely nothing to do&#34; with his son&#39;s acceptance. &#34;Matthew did not need any help because he had phenomenal grades,&#34; he said. &#34;I was qualified in getting in to Harvard,&#34; Matthew said. &#34;At the same time, I do think legacy helped me. I don&#39;t think legacy is a fair criterion for people to get into college. But for me, that was the way it was.&#34; Like Matthew Burr, Jessica Zofnass had excellent grades in prep school but an SAT score (1410) below the Harvard average. Jessica, who enrolled in 2004 (followed by her sister Rebecca in 2005), is the daughter and granddaughter of Harvard alumni; her father, COUR member Paul Zofnass, endowed a scholarship in environmental studies. &#34;I don&#39;t think I got into Harvard for my SAT scores,&#34; Jessica told me. &#34;Hopefully it wasn&#39;t just legacy. More of what I did at Choate [Wallingford, Connecticut, prep school Choate Rosemary Hall] was being well rounded, captain of a lot of sports teams, president of the French Club. &#34;It&#39;s really exciting for me to be here. But it&#39;s a very unjust society if the people who already have the benefits and the advantages and already have a wonderful life get an additional leg up. I&#39;m very torn. If I were born into a family that was less advantaged, I would feel very bitter about the legacy status.&#34; Paul Zofnass, a financial consultant to environmental firms, donated between $250,000 and $500,000 to Harvard in 2003-4, when Jessica was a senior at Choate, and says he is also &#34;very committed&#34; to raising donations from his Harvard classmates. Zofnass told me Jessica &#34;clearly had the credentials for someone to get into Harvard. I&#39;ve also known plenty of kids who were every bit as good as her and they didn&#39;t get in. Why? My involvement helped a little bit. Had I had nothing to do with Harvard, she probably would have gotten in, but I&#39;m not sure.&#34; Another COUR member&#39;s son, a Harvard undergraduate, told me that he graduated in the middle of his prep school class with an SAT score in the 1300s--&#34;not too good by Harvard standards,&#34; he acknowledged. His father, an alumnus, donated more than $1 million to the 1990s campaign, plus half a million in his son&#39;s freshman year. Still, the student said he felt no qualms over his admission. &#34;Definitely legacy was a factor, but I don&#39;t feel like someone else should be here instead of me,&#34; he said. &#34;I don&#39;t feel guilty. A lot of people I know at Harvard are very, very, very, very intelligent, but they just sit on their asses. With my work ethic and potential, test scores that may be a little less than some others shouldn&#39;t get in the way of possibilities for me and my life.&#34; He said his father donated to Harvard out of love for the institution, not to sway admissions. Most of these upper-class legacies went to prep schools, where they participated in aristocratic pastimes such as squash, crew, and sailing. Largely played by affluent whites, these sports offer a college admissions entree unavailable to most public school and inner-city students. Some of the COUR children were skilled enough--and had the right pedigree--to impress Harvard coaches who submit lists of potential recruits to the admissions office.</p><h2>The Merriam-Webster New Book of Word Histories</h2><p>&#34;A gold mine of word histories for reference or browsing.

What is it we are looking for? How does our understanding of an image change over time? In his latest book T. J. Clark addresses these questions&#x2014;and many more&#x2014;in ways that steer art writing into new territory.<br><br> In early 2000 two extraordinary paintings by Poussin hung in the Getty Museum in a single room, <i>Landscape with a Man Killed by a Snake</i> (National Gallery, London) and the Getty's own <i>Landscape with a Calm</i>. Clark found himself returning to the gallery to look at these paintings morning after morning, and almost involuntarily he began to record his shifting responses in a notebook. The result is a riveting analysis of the two landscapes and their different views of life and death, but more, a chronicle of an investigation into the very nature of visual complexity. Clark&#x2019;s meditations&#x2014;sometimes directly personal, sometimes speaking to the wider politics of our present image-world&#x2014;track the experience of viewing art through all its real-life twists and turns.</p><p><b>T.

Pardee Chair at the University of California, Berkeley, and author of several books including the highly influential volume, <i>The Painting of Modern Life: Paris in the Art of Manet and his Followers</i>. <br>". . . as compelling as a thriller...Clark shows that this [book] really is the merest doorway to what is ultimately a truly sublime mystery."&#x2014;John McEwan, <i>The Tablet</i><br>"What holds the reader is a vivid immersion in the author's process of discovery. His blend of thinking and noticing grips us as details are revealed in the room's ever-shifting light. . . . Numerous color plates, first of the paintings in full, then of enlarged details, train our new eyes."&#x2015;Nina C. Ayoub, <i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i><br><p>"Provocative, insightful and . . . useful."&#x2014;Edward J. Sozanski, <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i></p><br>"<i>The Sight of Death</i> is a delight for the level of the writing, the quality of the observation, and the attention it lavishes on looking&#x2015;an activity most of us take for granted."&#x2015;<i>The Bloomsbury Review</i><br>"<i>The Sight of Death</i> is a tour de force of looking. . . . Clark helps us see why it is so rewarding, indeed even necessary, to go back again and again to look at the same painting. He puts into words, better than anyone else I have read, why paintings can never be completely fixed in memory, but rather appear different each time we go back and see them again. . . . A deeply personal and passionate book about art, art history, and politics."&#x2015;Donna Gustafson, <i>Commonweal</i><br>"Clark remains, as he has always been, an imaginative and challenging writer whose thought . . . demands serious and rigorous attention. There is no question that he renders these two painting by Poussin extraordinarily vivid and rich, prompting something akin to the intense pleasure and excitement, sudden ideas and insights that can be produced by immersion in the galleries of a first-rate museum. He is his own best example of an author who changes the way we look at a given picture via his or her exquisite immanent analysis."&#x2015;James A. van Dyke, <i>Oxford Art Journal</i><br></p><h2>Woman in White (Tales of Mystery &amp; the Supernatural)</h2><p>Introduction and Notes by Dr Jeff Wallace, University of Glamorgan Lawrence&#39;s finest, most mature novel initially met with disgust and incomprehension. In the love affairs of two sisters, Ursula with Rupert, and Gudrun with Gerald, critics could only see a sorry tale of sexual depravity and philosophical obscurity. Women in Love is, however, a profound response to a whole cultural crisis. The &#39;progress&#39; of the modern industrialised world had led to the carnage of the First World War. What, then, did it mean to call ourselves &#39;human&#39;? On what grounds could we place ourselves above and beyond the animal world? What are the definitive forms of our relationships - love, marriage, family, friendship - really worth? And how might they be otherwise? Without directly referring to the war, Women in Love explores these questions with restless energy. As a sequel to The Rainbow, the novel develops experimental techniques which made Lawrence one of the most important writers of the Modernist movement.</p><p>This edition of Women in Love clears the text of literally thousands of accumulated errors allowing its readers to read and understand the novelist&#39;s work as Lawrence himself created it. The introduction gives a full history of the novel&#39;s composition, revision, publication and reception, and notes explain allusions and references.D.H. Lawrence's magnificent exploration of human sexuality in the days surrounding World War I. <p></p><p>"Let us hesitate no longer to announce that the sensual passions and mysteries are equally sacred with the spiritual mysteries and passions," wrote D.H. Lawrence in <i>Women In Love</i>, a masterpiece that heralded the erotic consciousness of the twentieth century. Echoing elements of Lawrence's own life, <i>Women In Love</i> delves into the mysteries between men and women as two couples strive for love against a haunting backdrop of coal mines, factories, and a beleaguered working class.</p><p></p><p>New introduction by Louis Menand.</p></p><h2>The Visit</h2><p>Friedrich D�rrenmatt is considered one of the most significant playwrights of our time. During the years of the Cold War, arguably only Beckett, Camus, Sartre, and Brecht rivaled him as a presence in European letters. In this ALTA National Translation Award winning new translation of what many critics consider his finest play, Joel Agee gives a fresh lease to a classic of twentieth-century theater. D�rrenmatt once wrote of himself: I can best be understood if one grasps grotesqueness,&#x201d; and <i>The Visit</i> is a consummate, alarming D�rrenmatt blend of hilarity, horror, and vertigo. The play takes place somewhere in Central Europe&#x201d; and tells of an elderly millionairess who, merely on the promise of her millions, swiftly turns a depressed area into a boom town. But the condition attached to her largesse, which the locals learn of only after they are enmeshed, is murder. D�rrenmatt has fashioned a macabre and entertaining parable that is a scathing indictment of the power of greed and confronts the perennial questions of honor, loyalty, and community.</p><p>Friedrich Durrenmatt was born in Switzerland in 1921 and has long been considered one of the world's leading German-language playwrights. His plays have received international acclaim, with <i>The Visit</i>, <i>Romulus the Great</i>, and <i>The Physicists</i> having been performed on Broadway and in major capitals throughout the world. D�rrenmatt&#x2019;s concerns are timeless, but they are also the product of his Swiss vantage during the cold war: his key plays explore such themes as guilt by passivity, the refusal of responsibility, greed and political decay, and the tension between justice and freedom. Durrenmatt died in December 1990.<br>Joel Agee is the author of two memoirs, <i>Twelve Years: An American Boyhood in East Germany</i> and <i>In The House Of My Fear</i>.

What is a concerned--and embarrassed--parent to do? With wit, wisdom, and savvy, Deborah Roffman translates her experiences gleaned from decades of teaching kids and parents, and as a mom, into strategies to help parents navigate this tricky terrain. <i>Talk to Me First</i> is for any parent who wants to become and remain the most credible and influential resource about sexuality in their children's lives.</p><p><br><b>Deborah M. Roffman </b>is a former member of the National Advisory Council for Sexual Health. Her work on childhood and teen sexuality has been featured in the <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, and <i>Boston Globe</i> and on national media outlets such as <i>Nightline, 20/20, </i>and NPR. Author of three widely acclaimed books for parents and teachers, Deborah was one of the original pioneers in the field. A teacher, workshop presenter, curriculum consultant, and parent educator, she has worked with over 300 public and private schools in the US and abroad, and scores of youth serving agencies. She continues to teach sexuality education in grades 4-12 at the Park School of Baltimore and other independent schools.Sex educator Roffman...encourages parents to &#x201c;stay ahead of the media tsunami&#x201d; and take their rightful place&#x2014;partnering with schools&#x2014;as the &#x201c;go to person&#x201d; when it comes to educating their kids about sex. For Roffman, human sexuality is the &#x201c;richest, deepest, and most extensive&#x201d; subject there is, and one can clearly sense her joy and exuberance in addressing her subject. But, she says, many parents are fearful and squeamish about talking with their kids about sex, which leaves the topic up to media outlets, advertisers, merchandisers, and others who are engaged in the &#x201c;adultification&#x201d; of children, without their best interests in mind. Roffman stresses that talking to kids about sex in a &#x201c;sensible, normal and matter-of-fact&#x201d; way is the goal, but first parents must overcome their own fear of using the words and talking the talk. She suggests that parents don a metaphorical &#x201c;five-piece suit&#x201d; and get to work, addressing five core issues of affirmation, information, clarity about values, setting limits, and anticipatory guidance. Roffman&#x2019;s frank and vibrant pep talk will give parents the inspiration and tools needed to tackle the subject of sex with their kids.</p><h2>The Black Holocaust for Beginners</h2><p>An introduction to the horrors endured by African Americans between the fifteenth and nineteenth centuries provides information that reveals how some one hundred million Africans died as a direct result of the slave trade and slavery.

Drawing on his own family&#x2019;s history as spice traders, as well as travel narratives, historical accounts, and his expertise as an ethnobotanist, Nabhan describes the critical roles that Semitic peoples and desert floras had in setting the stage for globalized spice trade.<br><br> Traveling along four prominent trade routes&#x2015;the Silk Road, the Frankincense Trail, the Spice Route, and the Camino Real (for chiles and chocolate)&#x2015;Nabhan follows the caravans of itinerant spice merchants from the frankincense-gathering grounds and ancient harbors of the Arabian Peninsula to the port of Zayton on the China Sea to Santa Fe in the southwest United States. His stories, recipes, and linguistic analyses of cultural diffusion routes reveal the extent to which aromatics such as cumin, cinnamon, saffron, and peppers became adopted worldwide as signature ingredients of diverse cuisines. <i>Cumin, Camels, and Caravans</i> demonstrates that two particular desert cultures often depicted in constant conflict&#x2015;Arabs and Jews&#x2015;have spent much of their history collaborating in the spice trade and suggests how a more virtuous multicultural globalized society may be achieved in the future.<br> &nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Cumin, Camels, and Caravans</i> is epic in its scope, spanning continents and millennia and exploring how the emergence and development of the spice trade set in motion the process of globalization. Gary Nabhan is a master storyteller with a broad, multidisciplinary perspective. He provides vivid tales of historical figures and his own travels along the ancient spice routes, fascinating observations of cross-cultural linguistic and culinary parallels, and reflections on how the spice trade influenced his own family&#x2019;s migrations.

Accustomed to living in a sod house and toiling alongside the men in the fields, she is unprepared for the lecherous reaction her lush sensuality provokes when she moves to the city. Despite betrayal and crushing opposition, �ntonia steadfastly pursues her quest for happiness&#x2014;a moving struggle that mirrors the quiet drama of the American landscape.</p><p>It seems almost sacrilege to infringe upon a book as soulful and rich as Willa Cather's <i>My �ntonia</i> by offering comment. First published in 1918, and set in Nebraska in the late 19th century, this tale of the spirited daughter of a Bohemian immigrant family planning to farm on the untamed land ("not a country at all but the material out of which countries are made") comes to us through the romantic eyes of Jim Burden. He is, at the time of their meeting, newly orphaned and arriving at his grandparents' neighboring farm on the same night her family strikes out to make good in their new country. Jim chooses the opening words of his recollections deliberately: "I first heard of �ntonia on what seemed to be an interminable journey across the great midland plain of North America," and it seems almost certain that readers of Cather's masterpiece will just as easily pinpoint the first time they heard of �ntonia and her world. It seems equally certain that they, too, will remember that moment as one of great light in an otherwise unremarkable trip through the world.<p> �ntonia, who, even as a grown woman somewhat downtrodden by circumstance and hard work, "had not lost the fire of life," lies at the center of almost every human condition that Cather's novel effortlessly untangles. She represents immigrant struggles with a foreign land and tongue, the restraints on women of the time (with which Cather was very much concerned), the more general desires for love, family, and companionship, and the great capacity for forbearance that marked the earliest settlers on the frontier.</p><p> As if all this humanity weren't enough, Cather paints her descriptions of the vastness of nature--the high, red grass, the road that "ran about like a wild thing," the endless wind on the plains--with strokes so vivid as to make us feel in our bones that we've just come in from a walk on that very terrain ourselves. As the story progresses, Jim goes off to the University in Lincoln to study Latin (later moving on to Harvard and eventually staying put on the East Coast in another neat encompassing of a stage in America's development) and learns Virgil's phrase "<i>Optima dies ... prima fugit</i>" that Cather uses as the novel's epigraph. "The best days are the first to flee"--this could be said equally of childhood and the earliest hours of this country in which the open land, much like <i>My �ntonia</i>, was nothing short of a rhapsody in prairie sky blue. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>"The best thing I've done is <i>My Antonia</i>," recalled Willa Cather. "I feel I've made a contribution to American letters with that book."<p> An unconventional novel of prairie life, <i>My Antonia</i> tells the story of a remarkable woman whose strength and passion epitomize the pioneer spirit. Antonia Shimerda returns to Black Hawk, Nebraska, to made a fresh start after eloping with a railway conductor following the tragic death of her father. Accustomed to living in a sod house and toiling alongside the men in the fields, she is unprepared for the lecherous reaction her lush sensuality provokes when she moves to the city.

She would hum a melody from deep within her belly, gliding sure-footed across the frozen river to the other side.<br> <br><i>Can you hear it?</i> she&#x2019;d ask. <i>The moon is whispering your secrets. It knows your darkest thoughts.</i> My grandmother was like that&#x2014;strange and beautiful, with stories resting just behind her eyelids. Stories about moonlight and riddles and catastrophes. Dreadful tales. But bright, cheery ones too. Walking beside her, I mirrored each step she took into the wilderness, in awe of how swiftly she avoided stinging nettles and poison buckthorns. How her hands traced the bark of every tree we passed, knowing its age just by touch. She was a wonder&#x2014;her chin always tilted to the sky, craving the anemic glow of moonlight against her olive skin, a storm always brewing along her edges.<br> <br>But tonight, I walk without her, chasing that same moon up the same dark, frozen river&#x2014;hunting for lost things inside the cold, mournful forest.<br> <br>Tree limbs sag and drip overhead. An owl hoots from a nearby spruce. And Fin and I slog deeper into the mountains, his wolf tail slashing above him, nose to the air, tracking some unknown scent to the far side of the riverbank.<br> <br>Two weeks have passed since the storm blew over Jackjaw Lake. Two weeks since the snow fell and blocked the only road out of the mountains. Two weeks since the electricity popped and died.<br> <br>And two weeks since a boy from the camp across the lake went missing.<br> <br>A boy whose name I don&#x2019;t even know.<br> <br>A boy who ran away or got lost or simply vanished like the low morning fog that rises up from the lake during autumn rainstorms. Who crept from his bunk inside one of the camp cabins and never returned. A victim of the winter cold. Of madness or desperation. Of these mountains that have a way of getting inside your head&#x2014;playing tricks on those who dare to walk among the pines long after the sun has set.<br> <br>These woods are wild and rugged and unkind.<br> <br>They cannot be trusted.<br> <br>Yet, this is where I walk: deep into the mountains. Where no others dare to go.<br> <br>Because I am more darkness than girl. More winter shadows than August sunlight. <i>We are the daughters of the wood</i>, my grandmother would whisper.<br> <br>So I push farther up the shore of the Black River, following the map made by the stars, just like she taught me. Just like all Walkers before me.<br> <br>Until I reach <i>the place</i>.<br> <br>The place where the line of trees breaks open to my right, where two steep ridges come together to form a narrow passage into a strange, dark forest to the east&#x2014;a forest that is much older than the pines along the Black River. Trees that are bound in and closed off and separate from the rest.<br> <br>The Wicker Woods.<br> <br>A mound of rocks stands guard ahead of me: flat stones pulled up from the riverbed and stacked four feet high beside the entrance to the wood. It&#x2019;s a warning. A sign to turn back. <i>Only the foolish enter here.</i> Miners who panned for gold along the riverbank built the cairn to steer away those who would come later, those who might wander into this swath of land, unaware of the cruel dark that awaited them.<br> <br>The rocks that mark the entrance have never toppled, never collapsed under the weight of snow or rain or autumn winds.<br> <br>This is the border.<br> <br><i>Only enter under a full moon</i>, Grandma cautioned, eyes like watery pools dewing at the edges. Inside this hallowed wood, I will find lost items, but only beneath a full moon&#x2014;when the forest sleeps, when the pale glow of moonlight lulls it into slumber&#x2014;can I slip through unnoticed. Unharmed. <i>A sleeping forest will allow safe passage. But if it wakes, be prepared to run.</i><br> <br>Each month, when the swollen moon rises in the sky, I enter the Wicker Woods in search of lost things hidden among the greening branches and tucked at the base of trees. Lost sunglasses, rubber flip-flops, cheap plastic earrings in the shape of watermelons and unicorns and crescent moons. Toe rings and promise rings given to girls by lovesick boys. The things that are lost at Jackjaw Lake in summers past are once again found in the woods. Appearing as if the forest is giving them back.<br> <br>But sometimes, under a particularly lucky full moon, I find items much older&#x2014;long forgotten things, whose owners fled these mountains a century ago. Silver lockets and silver buttons and silver sewing notions. Toothbrushes made of bone, medicine bottles with labels long since worn away, cowboy boots and tin cans once filled with powdered milk and black coffee grounds. Watch fobs and doorknobs. And from time to time, I even find gold itself: crude coins hammered into a disc, gold nuggets tangled in moss, flakes that catch in my hair.<br> <br><i>Lost things found.</i><br> <br>By magic or maleficence, these things appear in the woods. Returned.<br> <br>Fin sniffs the air, hesitant. And I draw in a breath, spinning the thin gold ring around my index finger. A habit. A way to summon the courage of my grandmother, who gave me the ring the night she died.<br> <br>&#x201c;I am Nora Walker,&#x201d; I whisper.<br> <br><i>Let the forest know your name.</i> It had seemed stupid once&#x2014;to speak aloud to the trees. But after you step into the dark and feel the cold pass through you&#x2014;the trees swallowing all memory of light&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll tell the Wicker Woods all manner of secrets. Stories you&#x2019;ve kept hidden inside the cage of your chest. Anything to lull the forest&#x2014;to keep it in slumber.<br> <br>I pinch my eyes closed and step over the threshold, through the line of tall soldier trees standing guard, into the dark of the forest.<br> <br>Into the Wicker Woods.<br> <br>Nothing good lives here.<br> <br>The air is cold and damp, and the dark makes it hard to see anything beyond your toes. But it always feels this way&#x2014;each time colder and darker than the last. I breathe slowly and move forward, stepping carefully, deliberately, over fallen logs and dewdrop flowers frozen in place. In winter, these woods feel like a fairy tale suspended in time&#x2014;the princess forgotten, the hero eaten whole by a noble fir goblin. The story ended, but no one remembered to burn the haunted forest to the ground.<br> <br>I duck beneath an archway of thorny twigs and dead cypress vines. Keeping my gaze at my feet, I&#x2019;m careful to never linger long on a single shadow, a thing skittering just beyond my vision&#x2014;my mind will only make it worse. Twist it into something with horns and fangs and copper eyes.<br> <br>The dead stir inside this ancient wood.<br> <br>They claw their fingernails along the bark of hemlock trees, they wail up through the limbs, searching for the moonlight&#x2014;for any sliver of the sky. But there is no light in this place. The Wicker Woods are where old, vengeful things lurk&#x2014;things much older than time itself. Things you don&#x2019;t want to meet in the dark. <i>Get in. Get the hell out.</i><br> <br>Fin follows close at my heels, no longer leading the way&#x2014;so close his footsteps match mine. Human shadow. Dog shadow.<br> <br><i>I am a Walker</i>, I remind myself when the thorn of fear begins to wedge itself along my spine, twisting between flesh and bone, prodding me to run. <i>I belong in these trees.</i> Even if I&#x2019;m not as formidable as my grandmother or as fearless as my mom, the same blood swells through my veins. Black as tar. The blood that gives all Walkers our nightshade, our &#x201c;shadow side.&#x201d; The part of us that is different&#x2014;odd, uncommon. Grandma could slip into other people&#x2019;s dreams, and Mom can lull wild honeybees into sleep. But on nights like this, venturing into the cruelest part of the forest, I often feel terrifyingly ordinary and I wonder if the trees can sense it too: I am a girl barely able to call herself descended from witches.<br> <br>Barely able to call myself a Walker.<br> <br>Yet, I press forward, squinting through the dark and scanning the exposed roots poking up through the snow, searching for hidden things wedged among the lichen and rocks. Something shiny or sharp-cornered or rusted with time. Something man-made&#x2014;something that&#x2019;s value is measured by weight.<br> <br>We pass over a dried creek bed, and the wind changes direction from east to north. The temperature dips. An owl cries in the distance, and Fin stops beside me&#x2014;nose twitching in the air. I touch his head gently, feeling the quick pace of his breathing.<br> <br>He senses something.<br> <br>I pause and listen for the snapping of branches underfoot, for the sounds of a wolf stalking through the trees, watching us. Hunting.<br> <br>But a moth skims past my shoulder&#x2014;white wings beating against the cold, flitting toward a sad, spiny-looking hemlock tree, leaving imprints of dust wherever it lands. It looks as if it&#x2019;s just come through a storm, wings torn at the edges. Shredded.<br> <br>A moth who&#x2019;s faced death. Who&#x2019;s seen it up close.<br> <br>My heartbeat sinks into my toes and my eyelashes twitch, certain I&#x2019;m not seeing it right. Just another trick of the woods.<br> <br>But I know what it is&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve seen sketches of them before. I&#x2019;ve even seen one pressed against the window while my grandmother coughed from her room down the hall, hands clasping the bedsheets. Blood in her throat.<br> <br>A bone moth.<br> <br>The worst kind. The bringer of portents and warnings, of omens that should never be ignored. <i>Of death.</i><br> <br>My fingers again touch the gold moonstone ring weighted heavy on my finger.<br> <br>Every part of me that had felt brave, had felt the courage of my grandmother pulsing through me, vanishes. I squeeze my eyes closed, then open them again, but the moth is still there. Zigzagging among the trees. &#x201c;We shouldn&#x2019;t be here,&#x201d; I whisper to Fin. <i>We need to run.</i><br> <br>I release my hand from Fin&#x2019;s head, and my heart scrapes against my ribs. I glance over my shoulder, down the narrow path we followed in. <i>Run, run, run!</i> my heart screams. I take a careful step back, away from the moth, not wanting to make a sound. But the moth circles overhead, bobbing quickly out over the trees&#x2014;called forth by something. Back into the dark.<br> <br>Relief settles through me&#x2014;my heart sinking back into my chest&#x2014;but then Fin breaks away from my side. He darts around a dead tree stump and into the brush, chasing after the moth. &#x201c;No!&#x201d; I shout&#x2014;<i>too loud</i>, my voice echoing over the layer of snow and bouncing through the treetops. But Fin doesn&#x2019;t stop. He tears around a cluster of spiny aspens and vanishes into the dark. Gone.<br> <br><i>Shit, shit, shit.</i><br> <br>If it were anything else, a different kind of moth, or another wolf he will chase deep into the snowy mountains only to return home in a day or two, I&#x2019;d let him go.<br> <br>But a bone moth means something else&#x2014;something cruel and wicked and bad&#x2014;so I run after him.<br> <br>I sprint around the clot of trees and follow him into the deepest part of the forest, past elms that grow at odd angles, down steep, jagged terrain I don&#x2019;t recognize&#x2014;where my boots slip beneath me, where my hands press against tree trunks to propel me forward, and where each footstep sounds like thunder against the frozen ground. <i>I&#x2019;m making too much noise. Too loud.</i> The woods will wake. But I don&#x2019;t slow down; I don&#x2019;t stop.<br> <br>I lose sight of him beyond two fallen trees, and little stabs of pain cut through me. &#x201c;Fin, please!&#x201d; I call in a near hush, trying to keep my voice low while the sting of tears presses against my eyes, blurring my vision. Panic leaps into my throat and I want to scream, shout Fin&#x2019;s name louder, but I bite back the urge. No matter what, I can&#x2019;t wake the woods, or neither Fin nor I will make it out of here.<br> <br>And then I see him: tail wagging, stopped a few yards away between a grove of hemlocks. My heart presses against my ribs.<br> <br>He&#x2019;s led us farther into the Wicker Woods than I&#x2019;ve ever been before. And the moth&#x2014;frayed body, white wings with holes torn along the edges&#x2014;flutters among the falling snowflakes, slow and mercurial, as if it were in no great hurry. It moves upward toward the sky, a speck of white among the black canopy of trees, and then vanishes into the dark forest to the north.<br> <br>I step carefully toward Fin and touch his ear to keep him from running after it again. But he bares his teeth, growling. &#x201c;Shhh,&#x201d; I say softly.<br> <br>His ears shift forward, his breathing quick as he sucks in bursts of air, and a low guttural growl rises up from deep within his chest.<br> <br><i>Something&#x2019;s out there.</i><br> <br>A beast or shadow with hooked claws and grim pinhole eyes. A thing the forest keeps, a thing it hides&#x2014;something I don&#x2019;t want to see.<br> <br>My fingers twitch, and dread rises up at the base of my throat. It tastes like ash. I hate this feeling building inside me. This awful fear. <i>I am a Walker.</i> I am the thing whispered about, the thing that conjures goose bumps and nightmares.<br> <br>I swallow and stiffen my jaw into place, taking a step forward. The moth led us here. To something just beyond my vision. I scan the dark, looking for eyes&#x2014;something blinking out from the trees.<br> <br>But there&#x2019;s nothing.<br> <br>I shake my head and let out a breath, about to turn back to Fin, when my left foot thuds against something on the ground. Something hard.<br> <br>I squint down at my feet, trying to focus in the dark.<br> <br>A mound of snow. A coat sleeve, I think. The tip of a boot. A thing that doesn&#x2019;t belong.<br> <br>And then I see. <i>See.</i><br> <br>Hands.<br> <br>There, lying beneath a dusting of snowfall, in the middle of the Wicker Woods, is a body.<br> <br>Snowflakes have gathered on stiff eyelashes.<br> <br>Eyes shuttered closed like two crescent moons. Pale lips parted open, waiting for the crows.<br> <br>Even the air between the trees has gone still, a tomb, as if the body is an offering that shouldn&#x2019;t be disturbed.<br> <br>I blink down at the corpse and a second passes, followed by another, my heart clawing silently upward into my windpipe. But no sound escapes my lips, no cry for help. I stare in stupefied inaction. My mind slows, my ears buzz&#x2014;an odd <i>crackle crack</i> crack, as if a radio were pressed to my skull. I inch closer and the trees quiver overhead. For a second I wonder if the entire forest might snap at the roots and upend itself&#x2014;trunks to the sky and treetops to the ground.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve seen dead birds in the woods before, even a dead deer with the antlers still attached to the hollowed-out skull. But never anything like this. Never a human body.<br> <br>Fin makes a low whine behind me. But I don&#x2019;t look back. I don&#x2019;t take my eyes off the corpse, like it might vanish if I look away.<br> <br>I swallow and crouch down, my knees pressing into the snow. Eyes watering from the cold. But I need to know.<br> <br><i>Is it him? The boy who went missing from the camp?</i><br> <br>His face is covered by a dusting of snow, dark hair frozen in place. There are no injuries that I can see. No trauma, no blood. And he hasn&#x2019;t been here long, or he wouldn&#x2019;t be here at all. The dead don&#x2019;t last in the mountains, especially in winter. Birds pick apart what they can before the wolves close in, scattering the bones across miles of terrain, leaving barely an imprint of what once had been. The forest is efficient at death, a swift wiping away. No remains to bury or burn or mourn.<br> <br>A soft wind stirs through the trees, blowing away the snow from hi...</p><h2>Can You Forgive Her?

Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.As young adult, Trollope endured seven years of poverty in the General Post Office in London before accepting a better-paying position as postal surveyor in Banagher, Ireland in 1841.

It studies a few widely used and time-tested devices in detail, and builds upon basic principles to establish a foundation for understanding and adapting to new technology and developments. <b></b> Chapter topics cover general amplifier concepts; ideal operational amplifier analysis and design; operational amplifier ac/dc effects and limitations; linear operational amplifier circuits; comparators; oscillators and waveform generators; active filters; rectifier, diode, and power circuits; analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion; miscellaneous circuits. <b></b> For practicing design engineers, technologists, and technicians. </p></p><p><p> Designed for both introductory and upper level courses covering Operational Amplifiers and Linear Integrated Circuits, Stanley's text focuses on developing the student's ability to analyze and design various circuit fluctuations. The focus is on applications, not rote memorization. </p> <p> The main features of the book include: </p> <ul> <li>Complete updating of the newer devices used in industry and available in the market.</li> <li>Inclusion of Electronics Workbench/MultiSim software example problems at the end of each chapter.</li> <li>End-of-chapter problems are divided into three categories&#x2014;drill, derivation, and design&#x2014;to help students fully understand and practice the various problems they will encounter in the workplace.</li> <li>Most chapters include additional laboratory exercises to provide sufficient work for the core of a supporting library.</li> </ul><p><b>PREFACE</b></p> <p> As in the first, second, and third editions, the primary objectives of this book are </p> <ul> <li>To establish the general methods for analyzing, modeling, and predicting the performance of operational amplifiers and related linear integrated circuits</li> <li>To develop the reader's facility in designing realistic circuits to perform specified operations</li> <li>To acquaint the reader with many of the common circuit configurations and enable the student to select available devices to use with these circuits</li> </ul> <p> All or portions of this book are usable for at least the following groups: </p> <ul> <li>Upper-division engineering technology students (junior or senior level)</li> <li>Lower-division engineering technology students (following the basic course sequence in discrete electronic devices and circuits)</li> <li>Applied engineering students</li> <li>Practicing design engineers, technologists, and technicians</li> </ul> <p> Engineering or engineering technology students who have had a course in circuit analysis employing frequency response analysis methods and a course in calculus should be able to cover the entire book. Calculus is used where appropriate, but virtually all results and design approaches can be understood <i>without calculus.</i> The large number of example problems and exercises make the book also valuable for self-study by practicing technical personnel. </p> <p> The primary emphasis throughout the book is on developing the reader's facility for analyzing and designing the various circuit functions, rather than on simply presenting a rote collection of existing circuits or showing numerous wiring diagrams for specialized integrated circuit modules. This establishes a foundation for understanding new developments as they arise. Since new devices constantly appear on the market and existing ones quickly become obsolete, we study only a few devices in detail. Those selected for this purpose have withstood the test of time and are widely used. Because the best way to adapt to new technology is to have a firm grasp of the basic principles, this book has been organized toward that goal. </p> <p> Chapter 1 provides some general models of linear amplifier circuits, definitions, and parameters. Students often miss these general concepts from the detailed material covered in basic electronic courses. This common deficiency is a case of the classical pattern of "not seeing the forest for the trees," and the material provided here will help solve that problem. </p> <p> Chapter 2 begins the analysis and design of operational amplifier circuits using ideal model assumptions. While the reader will not be able to see all the limitations of the circuits at this point, actual workable designs can be produced almost immediately from the information in this chapter, including amplifiers of various types, current sources, summing circuits, and various other applications. </p> <p> Chapters 3 and 4 are devoted to the practical limitations of realistic operational amplifiers and the associated effects on operating performance. Chapter 3 emphasizes do effects, including the effects of finite gain, finite input impedance, nonzero output impedance, input offset voltage, and input bias currents. Chapter 4 emphasizes ac effects, that is, those effects that are frequency dependent. Primary topics include closed-loop bandwidth relationships, effects of slew rate, and common-mode rejection. Chapter 5 considers additional linear applications, including frequency-dependent circuits such as integrators, differentiators, and phase shift networks. Instrumentation amplifiers and operation with a single power supply are also included. </p> <p> Comparator circuits form the basis for Chapter 6, including both open-loop comparators and comparators with feedback (Schmitt triggers). Along with the use of general purpose op-amps, a representative dedicated IC comparator (LM311) will be considered. </p> <p> Timers and oscillators are the topics of Chapter 7, which covers both analysis and design of an op-amp multivibrator and an op-amp square-wave/triangular wave generator. The Barkhausen criterion is introduced, and the Wien bridge and phase shift oscillators are included. The IC circuits considered are the 555 timer and the 8038 function generator chip. </p> <p> Chapter 8 is devoted to active filters, with emphasis on the widely used Butterworth function for low-pass filters and the standard resonance characteristic for band-pass filters. Finitegain low-pass and high-pass filter design data are included, and we also discuss the infinite-gain band-pass circuit design. The last portion of the chapter deals with the statevariable filter, for which low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, and band-rejection filters can be realized. After completing this chapter, the student should be able to design and implement a variety of practical active filters. </p> <p> Rectifier, diode, and power supply circuits form the basis for Chapter 9. Precision rectifier, holding, and limiting circuits are covered in the first part of the chapter, and the latter part of the chapter is devoted to power supply circuits. The development of the voltage regulator concept is included with this material. We also consider the use of a representative IC regulator (LM117/317). </p> <p> Chapter 10 considers the timely topic of data conversion, which we may think of as the bridge between the analog and digital worlds. We study both digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital conversion and some of the most common circuits. The concepts of voltage-to-frequency and frequency-to-voltage conversion are also discussed. Various miscellaneous topics that do not fit the objectives of earlier chapters appear in Chapter 11, including multipliers, logarithmic amplifiers, and phase-locked loops, along with application of an IC phase-locked loop (NE/SE565). </p> <p><b>Changes in the Fourth Edition</b></p> <p> The general organization of the text has remained virtually the same since the second edition. Some major changes were made then, but it appears that the information organization and flow have been quite satisfactory since that point. </p> <p> The most significant change for the fourth edition has been the replacement of PSPICE example problems at the end of most chapters with Multisim (Electronics Workbench) example problems. Multisim has made great strides in recent years and is now being widely used in engineering and engineering technology programs to model a variety of linear and nonlinear circuits. It is very user-friendly, and students can acquire proficiency in its operation very quickly. Moreover, users develop the circuit through the creation of a schematic diagram. Virtual instruments are available and their functions closely parallel that of real instruments. Thus, Multisim is very close to being a true "virtual laboratory." </p> <p> The Multisim examples are provided in the last sections of the chapters and generally utilize circuits that were analyzed or designed in the chapter. However, these sections may be omitted without loss of continuity for instructors who do not wish to cover this subject. </p> <p> Appendix E provides an abbreviated treatment of the basic concepts of schematic creation using Multisim for readers not having this background. Multisim example problems throughout the text provide further information about the use of various functions and models. </p> <p><b>Problems</b></p> <p> Most chapters contain end-of-chapter problems organized in three categories: Drill, Derivation, and Design. Drill problems make up the largest category. These are designed to test the reader's understanding of chapter principles. Problems are organized loosely in groups of two based on similar principles. Based on this grouping, answers to selected odd-numbered problems appear at the back of the book. Derivation problems require the reader to develop some of the results given in the text or to extend the results to new situations. Design problems require the reader to determine element values for a known circuit or a new circuit that will meet some prescribed specifications. Some of the design problems have a unique solution; others have more than one possible solution. Answers accompanied by an asterisk (*) are <i>typical solutions;</i> other valid solutions may be possible. </p> <p> <b>Laboratory Exercises</b> Most chapters also provide additional laboratory exercises, with a total of 52 exercises in Chapters 2 through 8. These exercises will provide sufficient work for the core of a supporting laboratory. It is assumed that the student who uses the laboratory exercises will already be familiar with basic test equipment and instrumentation such as voltmeters, ammeters, and the oscilloscope; consequently, statements such as "measure the voltage . . . " often appear without regard to the instrument type or procedure. </p> <p> <b>Safety</b> Although most of the laboratory exercises use relatively low voltages, there are always risks associated with the use of electrical equipment. Consequently, you should always follow the safety procedures learned in basic laboratory courses. You should have this instruction before you perform the exercises in this book. </p> <p><b>Equipment</b></p> <p> Minimal equipment is required to perform the exercises, and equipment is of the type normally found in most basic instructional laboratories. Further, the exercises have been designed to provide as much flexibility as possible. To provide full coverage, the following units should be available: </p> <p> <i>Circuit Trainer or "Breadboard"</i> A variety of solderless units are available, some of which also provide suppliers and a function generator. Obviously, hookup wire is also required. </p> <p> <i>Oscilloscope</i> Any modern dual-trace general-propose oscilloscope should be adequate. In fact, a single-trace oscilloscope can be used, but phase shift measurements are somewhat more involved. For brevity, the oscilloscope is referred to in some exercises as a CRO (cathode-ray oscilloscope). </p> <p> <i>Multimeter</i> A general-purpose multimeter capable of measuring both do and ac voltages and currents as well as passive resistance is appropriate. Either a digital or an analog instrument can be used. References to the multimeter in laboratory exercises are often made on the basis of the function involved; for example, "use a voltmeter to measure. . . ." </p> <p> <i>Function Generator</i> The desired unit should provide the choice of a sine wave, a squarewave, or a triangular wave over a frequency range from several hertz to at least 100 kHz. The output amplitude should be adjustable from zero to a level of at least several volts. A variable do offset, which may be used in conjunction with the output signal or as a separate adjustable do voltage, is a desirable feature. </p> <p> <i>Dual Power Supply</i> The unit should provide either two fixed voltages of + 15 V and -15 V or adjustable voltages that can be set at these levels. </p> <p> <i>Fixed 5-V DC Voltage</i> This standard digital TTL level is available in many circuit trainers and is convenient for several of the exercises. </p> <p> <b>Oscilloscope</b> The oscilloscope is probably the most important single instrument in measurements associated with linear circuits. In many exercises, you will be asked to sketch the forms of various waveforms and to show their time relationships. In virtually all cases, you should employ do coupling for this purpose. This is important because the base line of the trace represents a zero-voltage level, and it will be necessary to measure voltages above and below this level. The ac coupling input position should be used only when it is desirable to amplify a small time-varying component without the do level forcing the signal to shift off the screen. </p> <p> To show the time relationships, it is necessary that you establish a time reference on the trace. Often, the input voltage is the logical choice for this reference. For example, if the input signal is a sine wave, the beginning of a cycle is an ideal point at which to establish the reference. </p> <p> <b>Suppliers</b> <i>Resistors</i> The actual number of different values required is modest, but for maximum flexibility, an assortment of resistors with 5% tolerances in 1/4- or 1/2-W sizes covering the range from about 100 W to 5.6 M W is recommended. The most popular size is 10 kW, and you will need a minimum of five of that size. </p> <p> <i>Capacitors</i> An assortment of nonpolarized low-tolerance capacitors such as polystyrene or mylar in the range from about 0.001 mF to about 0.1 mF is recommended for critical applications such as active filters, oscillators, phase shift circuits, and so forth. In addition, larger-value polarized electrolytic (e.g., tantalum) and smaller-value disc ceramic capacitors may be used in noncritical bypass applications. </p> <p> <i>Potentiometers</i> A few potentiometers are desirable (and sometimes necessary) when a resistance must be adjusted to an exact value. Although the ranges are flexible, some suggested values are 0-1 kW, 0-10 kW, and 0-100 kW. </p> <p> <i>Electronic Components</i> You will need these electronic components: </p> <p> (5) 741 Operational amplifiers<br> (1) 311 Comparator<br> (1) 555 Timer<br> (1) 317 Regulator<br> (2) General purpose diodes </p></p><h2>Study Guide and Procedure Checklist Manual for Kinn&#39;s The Medical Assistant: An Applied Learning Approach</h2><p><p>Get more practice with the essential medical assisting job skills!

It details Thoreau&#39;s sojourn in a cabin near Walden Pond, amidst woodland owned by his friend and mentor Ralph Waldo Emerson. Walden was written with expressed seasonal divisions. Thoreau hoped to isolate himself from society in order to gain a more objective understanding of it. Simplicity and self-reliance were Thoreau&#39;s other goals, and the whole project was inspired by Transcendentalist philosophy. As pertinent and relevant today as it was when it was first written.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.In 1845 Henry David Thoreau left his pencil-manufacturing business and began building a cabin on the shore of Walden Pond near Concord, Massachusetts. This lyrical yet practical-minded book is at once a record of the 26 months Thoreau spent in withdrawal from society -- an account of the daily minutiae of building, planting, hunting, cooking, and, always, observing nature -- and a declaration of independence from the oppressive mores of the world he left behind. Elegant, witty, and quietly searching, Walden remains the most persuasive American argument for simplicity of life clarity of conscience.<br><br>For the first time, the authoritative editions of works by major American novelists, poets, scholars, and essayists collected in the hardcover volumes of The Library of America are being published singly in a series of handsome paperback books.

The person who acts upon such a desire is a Bodhisattva. 'S=antideva not only makes plain what the Bodhisattva must do and become, he also invokes the powerful feelings of aspiration that underlie such a commitment, employing language which has inspired Buddists ever since it first appeared. Indeed, his book has long been regarded as one of the most popular accounts of the Buddhist's spiritual path.<br> <br> Important as a manual of training among Mah=ay=ana Buddhists, especially in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, this text continues to be used as the basis for teaching by modern Buddhist teachers. This new translation from the original language provides detailed annotations explaining allusions and technical references. Also, the book's General Introduction and Translators' Introduction both serve to locate 'S=antideva's work in its proper context, and for the first time explain its structure.</p><p>Kate Crosby is Tutor in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Pali at Oxford University.

Experience with other scripting or programming languages (Perl, VBA, VB script, Java, C++) is helpful but not required. <br>The impetus for writing this book comes from the lessons I've learned from using and teaching geographic information systems (GIS) for over 10 years at several different universities. One of those lessons is that "a little bit of code can go a long way."<br><br>Those of us who learned our first computer skills back in the days of MS-DOS became familiar with using command prompt to carry out basic tasks. Early versions of ArcGIS for Desktop Advanced (ArcInfo) also relied heavily on a command line interface, in addition to the use of the ARC Macro Language (AML). More recently, however, most software has come to rely on a graphical user interface (GUI) with very limited need to use a command line interface or to write any code. As a result, the majority of current college students taking their first GIS course have never seen any form of code . Although the menu-driven user interface of ArcGIS for Desktop allows for very complicated operations and sophisticated spatial analysis, at some point users will run into tasks that require something more. That's where Python scripting comes in.<br><br>In a nutshell, Python scripting allows you to automate tasks in ArcGIS that would be very cumbersome using the regular menu-driven interface. For example, consider having to convert 1,000 shapefiles to feature classes in a geodatabase. You could run the appropriate tool 1,000 times, but surely there must be a more efficient and robust way to do this. That's what Python scripting will do and you will need only a handful of lines of code to carry out this task. About halfway through this book, you will write a script that does exactly this.<br><br>This book is designed to make the power of Python scripting available to those who have no experience in writing code. The book starts with the basics, such as what scripting is and how to write and execute simple lines of code. Following that, the book covers how to write scripts that work with spatial data in ArcGIS for Desktop. A good familiarity with ArcGIS for Desktop is assumed, including managing data in ArcCatalog and carrying out basic tasks in ArcMap, such as manipulating data, creating cartographic output, and running tools. You should also be familiar with the basic concepts of GIS, including coordinate systems, data formats, table operations, and basic spatial analysis methods. If you have some experience in writing code in any language, it will be helpful but is not required.<br><br>Why Python? A couple of reasons. First, Python is free and open source, meaning it can be freely distributed and shared. Second, it is a powerful and versatile language although still relatively easy to learn. Third, Esri has adopted Python as the preferred language to work with ArcGIS, which is strongly reflected in the functionality introduced in version 10.1.<br><br>There are numerous introductory textbooks on GIS and tutorials for learning ArcGIS. Most of them include sections on spatial analysis methods and procedures. However, coverage of Python scripts is not very complete. Although there is no lack of good introductory books on Python, most existing books cover Python without targeting a specific application. Python's role as a "glue" language is explained and demonstrated, but most books remain very general when it comes to how Python works with other programs.<br><br>There is no ArcGIS-specific version of the Python language and so you can start learning Python syntax using any of the general Python books. However, the objects we work with in ArcGIS (such as feature classes, polygons, and geoprocessing tools) are very different from the more generic objects used as examples in most existing titles. This makes it difficult for an experienced ArcGIS user to just pick up a general Python book and start writing scripts for ArcGIS. For an experienced programmer who has previously programmed with ArcGIS in either VBA or C++, such a generic Python reference might suffice<em>but other professionals will benefit greatly from a book that covers Python with a very specific focus on writing scripts for ArcGIS.<br><br>The primary audience for this book consists of experienced ArcGIS users who want to learn Python but have limited programming or scripting experience. Prior experience with other scripting or programming languages (such as Perl, VBA,&nbsp; VBScript, Java, or C++) will be helpful but is not required. More experienced programmers will also benefit, but the emphasis is on making Python scripting available to the large number of ArcGIS for Desktop users who want to get more out of the functions of ArcGIS without having to become full-time programmers and learning C++. Readers will, however, be expected to have good overall ArcGIS skills and a basic understanding of geoprocessing procedures.<br><br>This book is also intended for upper-division undergraduate and graduate courses in GIS. A handful of colleges and universities teach upper-division courses in GIS programming and/or scripting, and this number is expected to increase.<br><br>This book contains three major parts. Part 1 covers the fundamentals of geoprocessing in ArcGIS for Desktop as well as the fundamentals of the Python language. Depending on your background and experience, you may already be familiar with some or all of this material. Part 2 covers how to write scripts that work with spatial data. This is really the core of the book and includes chapters on executing tools in Python, describing data, and manipulating and creating data, as well as a number of more specialized tasks. Part 3 covers how to create a tool out of your script and how to share your tool with others. By the end of this book, you will be able to create custom tools that use Python scripting to automate basic tasks in ArcGIS for Desktop.<br><br>Each of the 14 chapters in the book is accompanied by an exercise reinforcing the concepts covered in the chapter. All 14 exercises are included on the Data and Exercises DVD that comes with the book. You should first read the chapter and then complete the accompanying exercise before moving on to the next chapter. Depending on your learning style and familiarity with coding, you can try some of the code in the chapters while you are reading it, but you can also first read the entire chapter and then start the exercise. You should complete the chapters and exercises in order since the concepts introduced in each new chapter build on the previous ones.<br><br>To do the exercises in this book, you need to have ArcGIS 10.1 for Desktop software installed on your computer, or else download a trial version of the software. See appendix C for instructions on how to download the software. You will need the code printed on the inside back cover of this book to access the download site. <br><br>This book will teach you techniques to automate tasks in ArcGIS. Perhaps by the end of the book, you will become a Python aficionado or perhaps you will simply be able to save yourself hours of work by using one of the scripts from the book. Whatever the case, beyond the specific skills of writing Python scripts for ArcGIS, you will also learn the basic logic of writing code. This will be helpful beyond the specific task at hand. My hope is that the book will contribute to demystifying what "writing code" really is for those who may be a little intimidated by it. And to show that writing code is not difficult to learn. Coding as an approach to solving problems is not only very powerful but also has widespread applicability. I sincerely hope this book will allow you to experience this versatility of Python coding. <br><br>Paul A.

To miss out on mathematics is to live without experiencing some of humanity&#x2019;s most beautiful ideas. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> In this profound book, written for a wide audience but especially for those disenchanted by their past experiences, an award-winning mathematician and educator weaves parables, puzzles, and personal reflections to show how mathematics meets basic human desires&#x2014;such as for play, beauty, freedom, justice, and love&#x2014;and cultivates virtues essential for human flourishing. These desires and virtues, and the stories told here, reveal how mathematics is intimately tied to being human. Some lessons emerge from those who have struggled, including philosopher Simone Weil, whose own mathematical contributions were overshadowed by her brother&#x2019;s, and Christopher Jackson, who discovered mathematics as an inmate in a federal prison. Christopher&#x2019;s letters to the author appear throughout the book and show how this intellectual pursuit can&#x2014;and must&#x2014;be open to all.</p><p><b>Francis Su</b> is the Benediktsson-Karwa Professor of Mathematics at Harvey Mudd College&nbsp;and the past president of the Mathematical Association of America.&nbsp;In 2013, he received the&nbsp;Haimo Award, a nationwide teaching prize for college math faculty, and in 2018 he won the Halmos-Ford writing award for the highly-acclaimed speech on which this book is based.

Gary Gerstle traces the forces of civic and racial nationalism, arguing that both profoundly shaped our society.</p><p> After Theodore Roosevelt led his Rough Riders to victory during the Spanish American War, he boasted of the diversity of his men's origins- from the Kentucky backwoods to the Irish, Italian, and Jewish neighborhoods of northeastern cities. Roosevelt's vision of a hybrid and superior "American race," strengthened by war, would inspire the social, diplomatic, and economic policies of American liberals for decades. And yet, for all of its appeal to the civic principles of inclusion, this liberal legacy was grounded in "Anglo-Saxon" culture, making it difficult in particular for Jews and Italians and especially for Asians and African Americans to gain acceptance.</p><p> Gerstle weaves a compelling story of events, institutions, and ideas that played on perceptions of ethnic/racial difference, from the world wars and the labor movement to the New Deal and Hollywood to the Cold War and the civil rights movement. We witness the remnants of racial thinking among such liberals as FDR and LBJ; we see how Italians and Jews from Frank Capra to the creators of Superman perpetuated the New Deal philosophy while suppressing their own ethnicity; we feel the frustrations of African-American servicemen denied the opportunity to fight for their country and the moral outrage of more recent black activists, including Martin Luther King, Jr., Fannie Lou Hamer, and Malcolm X.</p><p> Gerstle argues that the civil rights movement and Vietnam broke the liberal nation apart, and his analysis of this upheaval leads him to assess Reagan's and Clinton's attempts to resurrect nationalism. Can the United States ever live up to its civic creed? For anyone who views racism as an aberration from the liberal premises of the republic, this book is must reading.</p></p><p><p>"Historians and social scientists have been longing for ambitious syntheses that take into account recent contributions to social history and studies of culture while reinvigorating key themes in political history. This book's rich and learned assessment of the complexities of twentieth-century America and its appraisal of change provide just such a powerful diagnostic and temporal framework. Showing how civic and racial ideals have entwined to produce both expansive and restrictive results, <i>American Crucible</i> is thoughtfully instructive and lovely to read."--<b>Ira Katznelson, Ruggles Professor of Political Science and History, Columbia University.</b></p><p>"Fifty years ago, prominent historians celebrated the virtues of the 'American Creed' thirty years ago, their successors deplored the evils of 'Amerikka.' The best contemporary historians transcend these stereotypes by analyzing the many facets of Americanism, and <i>American Crucible</i> now sets the standard for the others. Its demonstration of how civic nationalism and racial nationalism change and how they change each other, its smooth movement from high diplomacy to comic strips, its refusal to settle for easy condemnation or celebration-together they add up to a terrific achievement."--<b>Jennifer Hochschild, Harvard University</b></p><p>"In <i>American Crucible</i>, Gary Gerstle traces the fundamental tension between the American belief in equality and the deeply rooted tradition of racial nationalism-the most significant and most sustained conflict throughout the history of the United States. Gerstle's angle of vision allows him to illuminate and place in larger context such seemingly diverse events and developments as World War I and multiculturalism, immigration policy and the Christian right, Teddy Roosevelt's reform agenda and the social upheavals of the 1960s. <i>American Crucible</i> provides invaluable insight into the shape and structure of contemporary American society through its unique exploration of the nation's past."--<b>Thomas Byrne Edsall, <i>Washington Post</i></b></p><p>"This work confirms Gary Gerstle's stature as one of our most imaginative and ambitious historians. His scholarship substantially redefines the meaning of key ideas about the twentieth-century United States and its culture, including ethnicity, citizenship, patriotism, and Americanism. Gerstle's capacity for revisionism, synthesis, and engaged writing reminds me of Richard Hofstadter, C. Van Woodword, and Warren Sussman. With this book, he enters their league."--<b>Nelson Lichtenstein, University of California, Santa Barbara</b></p><p>"This is one of those rare works of political and cultural history that compel us to rethink the nature and evolution of American society as a whole."--<b>Michael Kazin, Georgetown University</b></p><p>"A bold, provocative, and often disturbing book about the contest between racial and civic definitions of American nationhood. Rarely has a work of scholarship examined the history of racism and exclusion in such comprehensive and dismaying detail, or in such clear and persuasive prose. Gerstle also contributes to the growing interest among historians in the concept of 'whiteness' by closely examining changing views of white ethnicity in the twentieth century. <i>American Crucible</i> is an important and impressive book and a major contribution to our understanding of twentieth-century America."--<b>Alan Brinkley, Columbia University</b></p><p>"<i>American Crucible</i> dramatically portrays the century just past as one in which the United States saw inclusive traditions of civic nationalism compete with and partake of exclusionary racial nationalist traditions. Meticulous research and deep reflection prevent Gerstle from portraying either nationalism as the 'real' American way. The tension between the two and between the author's sober analysis and his strong personal advocacy of civic nationalism produces a remarkable study.

In these pages psychotherapist David Grand, Ph.D., describes his own first encounter with EMDR, then recounts the dramatic results of bringing this new therapy into the lives of his patients. By alternately stimulating the left and right sides of the brain to clear psychological blocks and resolve trauma, EMDR helped Grand&#x2019;s patients put the pieces of their emotionally shattered lives back together with a speed that exceeded his wildest dreams.<br><br>Grand&#x2019;s use of EMDR has helped people from all walks of life, from railroad engineers reliving the nightmare of death on the tracks to mothers of children killed on the mean streets of America&#x2019;s inner cities, from bomb victims in Belfast and Oklahoma City to Arabs and Israelis traumatized by decades of hatred and violence. His account of this work inspires and touches the reader&#x2019;s heart as it reveals the healing power of a process that works as swiftly as thought itself.<br><br>Grand takes EMDR&#x2013;developed by Francine Shapiro, M.D., only fourteen years ago&#x2013;far beyond its initial use in healing trauma. In addition to turbo- charging breakthroughs in psychotherapy, Grand uses EMDR to clear away blocks to performance and creativity. Remarkable examples show athletes, actors, musicians, and artists improving their performance, and a self-use chapter describes practical ways readers can apply this remarkable method to resolve fear of public speaking, enhance creativity, enjoy deeper, more restful sleep, resolve stress and anxiety, and much more.</p><p>&#x201c;Brain-imaging studies in the Amen Clinics have shown that EDMR can actually heal brain function after trauma.

Is the earth, which is obviously a fit environment for man and other organic life, a purposefully made creation? Have its climates, its relief, the configuration of its continents influenced the moral and social nature of individuals, and have they had an influence in molding the character and nature of human culture? In his long tenure of the earth, in what manner has man changed it from its hypothetical pristine condition?&nbsp;From the time of the Greeks to our own, answers to these questions have been and are being given so frequently and so continually that we may restate them in the form of general ideas: the idea of a designed earth; the idea of environmental influence; and the idea of man as a geographic agent. These ideas have come from the general thought and experience of men, but the first owes much to mythology, theology, and philosophy; the second, to pharmaceutical lore, medicine, and weather observation; the third, to the plans, activities, and skills of everyday life such as cultivation, carpentry, and weaving. The first two ideas were expressed frequently in antiquity, the third less so, although it was implicit in many discussions which recognized the obvious fact that men through their arts, sciences, and techniques had changed the physical environment about them.&nbsp;This magnum opus of Clarence Glacken explores all of these questions from Ancient Times to the End of the Eighteenth Century.</p><p>Western thought, writes Clarence Glacken in this magisterial, highly influential study, centers on three questions: Was the earth made for a reason? Does the earth shape human life? How have humans affected the earth? Tracing these three questions in turn deep into antiquity, Glacken shows how varied the answers have been. Aristotle, for instance, argued that there was purpose in nature, with each thing created for the benefit of something else--especially humans. Christian thinkers extended Aristotle's ideas, although, as Glacken warns, it is incorrect to assume that this presupposes a hostility toward or indifference to the natural world. Glacken closes his tome with the advent of modern science, when theological questions gave way in large measure to more modest, empirical questions of form and process. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>"Traces on the Rhodian Shore is one of the best and most important books published by a geographer in the English-speaking world in the last hundred years. as with many seminal books, the perception of its worth is likely to increase over a long time."--<i>Professional Geographer</i>&nbsp;"Through a highly interdisciplinary framework, Glacken relates social and natural phenomena to the supposed dichotomy of man and nature. Environmental influences on culture and vice versa are discussed from an original point of view; it is avery timely subject. Containing a wealth of data and new approaches to the story of the development of human society, the account is absorbing and thought provoking for men in all areas as well as the educated laymen."--<i>Choice</i>&nbsp;"A book such as this rarely appear anymore. . . .Its size, its comprehensiveness, its involvement with the classical sources, its modesty, and its urbanity make this an unusual book. Its rarity, however, in now ay diminishes its value, whether for the general historical or for the historian of those particular disciplines specifically concerned with the nature of man and his place in nature."--<i>American Anthropologist</i></p><h2>Interviewing as Qualitative Research: A Guide for Researchers in Education and the Social Sciences, 3rd Edition</h2><p>The third edition of this bestselling resource provides clear, step-by-step guidance for new and experienced interviewers to help them develop, shape, and reflect on interviewing as a qualitative research process.

The brief introductory prayer sentences are from various sources - the Bible and traditional prayers of the church or of well-known spiritual writers. The spiritual readings come from eleven of Father Keatings books and one audiotape, with a month&#39;s worth of readings derived from each work.

They can inhabit people, objects, portions of land, or whole territories, depending on their purpose. They do not care what they inhabit, as long as they can accomplish their assigned objectives. They can gain access through sin, trauma, victimization, witchcraft, occult practices, or cursing. While we do not want to become fascinated with demons, we must be aware of what they are and how they operate in order to keep our own homes free of spiritual darkness.</p><h2>Doing Child and Adolescent Psychotherapy: Adapting Psychodynamic Treatment to Contemporary Practice</h2><p>This readable guide for therapists and therapists-in-training lays out the theoretical essence and practical essentials of doing child and adolescent psychotherapy from the referral call to the last goodbye.</p><p>A practical and comprehensive guide that covers the therapy process from the referral call to the final goodbye, this h ands-on guide thoroughly portrays the challenge, intricacies,s and subtleties of the client-therapist relationship. <p>Part I, <b>The Essentials</b>, addresses how to begin treatment, the mechanics of therapeutic powers, the need for limits, and the techniques of therapeutic talk and query, Part II, <b>Techniques and Tools</b>, offers pragmatic and lively discussion on the use of puppet play, games, toys, and art in child therapy, paying special attention to the ways play and talk are balanced.

From the author of Dubliners, Ulysses and Finnegan&#39;s Wake.</p><p>7 1.5-hour cassettesPerhaps Joyce&#39;s most personal work, &#34;A Portrait Of The Artist As A Young Man depicts the intellectual awakening of one of literature&#39;s most memorable young heroes, Stephen Dedalus. Through a series of brilliant epiphanies that parallel the development of his own aesthetic consciousness, Joyce evokes Stephen&#39;s youth, from his impressionable years as the youngest student at the Clongowed Wood school to the deep religious conflict he experiences at a day school in Dublin, and finally to his college studies where he challenges the conventions of his upbringing and his understanding of faith and intellectual freedom. James Joyce&#39;s highly autobiographical novel was first published in the United States in 1916 to immediate acclaim. Ezra Pound accurately predicted that Joyce&#39;s book would &#34;remain a permanent part of English literature,&#34; while H.G. Wells dubbed it &#34;by far the most important living and convincing picture that exists of an Irish Catholic upbringing.&#34; A remarkably rich study of a developing young mind, &#34;A Portrait Of The Artist As A Young Man made an indelible mark on literature and confirmed Joyce&#39;s reputation as one of the world&#39;s greatest and lasting writers.</p><h2>A Peterson Field Guide To Eastern Butterflies (Peterson Field Guides)</h2><p>This newly designed field guide features descriptions of 524 species of butterflies.

At its heart is the greatest of American paradoxes: How have tiny minorities of the rich and privileged consistently exercised so much power in a nation built on the notion of rule by the people? </p><p>In a series of thought-provoking essays, leading scholars of American history examine every epoch in which ruling economic elites have shaped our national experience. They explore how elites came into existence, how they established their dominance over public affairs, and how their rule came to an end. The contributors analyze the elite coalition that led the Revolution and then examine the antebellum planters of the South and the merchant patricians of the North. Later chapters vividly portray the Gilded Age "robber barons," the great finance capitalists in the age of J. P. Morgan, and the foreign-policy "Establishment" of the post-World War II years. The book concludes with a dissection of the corporate-led counter-revolution against the New Deal characteristic of the Reagan and Bush era.</p><p>Rarely in the last half-century has one book afforded such a comprehensive look at the ways elite wealth and power have influenced the American experiment with democracy. At a time when the distribution of wealth and power has never been more unequal, <i>Ruling America</i> is of urgent contemporary relevance.</p></p><p>Steve Fraser is a writer and historian living in New York.http://www.hup.harvard.edu/pdf/FRARUL_excerpt.pdf</p><h2>Titian: Nymph and Shepherd</h2><p>Titian: Nymph and Shepherd is presented as a series of stimulating letters exchanged between the internationally renowned author and art critic John Berger and his daughter, Katya.<br>This correspondence is the extraordinary vehicle for a series of insights into the everyday life and the art of the great Venetian master, following an uncanny incident at the great exhibition of his work staged in Venice in 1990.<br>While attending the exhibition Katya meets an old man, who she becomes convinced can only be the ghost of the great painter. Her "spiritual" visitor engages her in conversation about the minute particularities of painting some of the pictures there. She shares this experience with her father in a letter. He accepts the encounter at face value and discusses the historical background to the old man's remarks, seeking answers to a series of evidential questions about his daughter's encounter. From then on, the three of them, the old painter, the daughter, and the father discuss painting, bodies, animals, Greece, being a woman today, the constant enigma of existence, and daily life.<br>Titian: Nymph and Shepherd is richly illustrated with the famous Titian masterpieces shown at the exhibition, thus enabling readers to enter the visual adventure and judge for themselves what the visitor from four centuries ago has to say to us today.</p><p>John Berger was born in London.

With these words, Roland Barthes describes a concept that profoundly shaped his work and was the subject of a landmark series of lectures delivered in 1978 at the Coll�ge de France, just two years before his death. Not published in France until 2002, and appearing in English for the first time, these creative and engaging lectures deepen our understanding of Roland Barthes's intellectual itinerary and reveal his distinctive style as thinker and teacher. <br><br>The Neutral (<i>le neutre</i>), as Barthes describes it, escapes or undoes the paradigmatic binary oppositions that structure and produce meaning in Western thought and discourse. These binaries are found in all aspects of human society ranging from language to sexuality to politics. For Barthes, the attempt to deconstruct or escape from these binaries has profound ethical, philosophical, and linguistic implications. <br><br><i>The Neutral</i> is comprised of the prewritten texts from which Barthes lectured and centers around 23 "figures," also referred to as "traits" or "twinklings," that are possible embodiments of the Neutral (sleep, silence, tact, etc.) or of the anti-Neutral (anger, arrogance, conflict, etc.). His lectures draw on a diverse set of authors and intellectual traditions, including Lao-tzu, Tolstoy, German mysticism, classical philosophy, Rousseau, Baudelaire, Walter Benjamin, and John Cage. Barthes's idiosyncratic approach to his subjects gives the lectures a playful, personal, and even joyous quality that enhances his rich insights.<br><br>In addition to his reflections on a variety of literary and scholarly works, Barthes's personal convictions and the events of his life shaped the course and content of the lectures. Most prominently, as Barthes admits, the recent death of his mother and the idea of mourning shape several of his lectures.</p><p>Roland Barthes was one of the most influential critics and philosophers of the twentieth century.

He translated a wide range of Western works and adapted them to Japanese needs, inventing a colorful prose style close to the vernacular. He also authored many books, which were critical in introducing the powerful but alien culture of the West to the Japanese. Only by adopting the strengths and virtues of the West, he argued, could Japan maintain its independence despite the "disease" of foreign relations.<br><br>Dictated by Fukuzawa in 1897, this autobiography offers a vivid portrait of the intellectual's life story and a rare look inside the formation of a new Japan. Starting with his childhood in a small castle town as a member of the lower samurai class, Fukuzawa recounts in great detail his adventures as a student learning Dutch, as a traveler bound for America, and as a participant in the tumultuous politics of the pre-Restoration era. Particularly notable is Fukuzawa's ability to view the new Japan from both the perspective of the West and that of the old Japan in which he had been raised. While a strong advocate for the new civilization, he was always aware of its roots in the old.</p><p>Here is the autobiography of a remarkable man.

For more than half a century, scholars have attempted to find the organizing key&#x2015;the &#x201c;secret code&#x201d;&#x2015;to the beloved series, but it has remained a mystery. Until now. <br>In <i>The Narnia Code</i>, Michael Ward takes the reader through each of the seven Narnia books and reveals how each story embodies and expresses the characteristics of one of the seven planets of medieval cosmology&#x2015;Jupiter, Mars, Sol, Luna, Mercury, Venus and Saturn&#x2015;planets which Lewis described as &#x201c;spiritual symbols of permanent value.&#x201d; <br>How does medieval cosmology relate to the Christian underpinnings of the series? How did it impact Lewis&#x2019;s depiction of Aslan, the Christlike character at the heart of the books? And why did Lewis keep this planetary inspiration a secret?

What is needed is a new way of doing business-a method that is simultaneously socially responsible and far more effective than "old" marketing. This new way is The Irresistible Offer.</p> <p>"The Irresistible Offer is the missing link in many marketing books."<br> &#x2014;Joe Sugarman, Chairman, BluBlocker Corporation</p> <p>"The Irresistible Offer reveals secret after proven secret guaranteed to pump fresh power into your sales process."<br> &#x2014;John Du Cane, CEO, Dragon Door Publications, Inc.</p> <p>"As the world's fastest reader (Guinness Book certified) I've read just about every business and marketing book in existence. The Irresistible Offer by Mark Joyner is, by far, the easiest and most powerful. If you want to make a profitable business (any business small or large), The Irresistible Offer should be your starting point."<br> &#x2014;Howard Berg, "The World's Fastest Reader"</p> <p>"I've read every book on marketing printed in the last 150 years.

Tock. <p>Tic. Tock.</p> <p>Tic. Tock.</p> <p>Three seconds.</p> <p>That's all you've really got to make the sale.</p> <p>With consumers bombarded with thousands of marketing messages a day, they have to make purchasing decisions quickly, which means you have to make the sale just as quickly. There's simply no time for you to make any offer besides the one offer that will work and work quickly&#x2014;The Irresistible Offer.</p> <p>But what is The Irresistible Offer? Simply put, it's the best (and maybe only) true alternative to the traditional form of selling with its sentimental manipulation, marketing trickery, and decreasing effectiveness. The Irresistible Offer is so good and so easy to understand that buying from you becomes a no-brainer for your customers. But it's not a one-time special or a "unique selling proposition." The Irresistible Offer is the offer that defines your business and becomes your raison d'�tre.</p> <p>Want an example? Domino's Pizza grew from a single store to a $4 billion chain in large part because they gave their customers an offer they couldn't refuse&#x2014;"thirty minutes or less" or the pizza was free. The success of that offer is obvious in retrospect. But how do you design The Irresistible Offer for your own business in your own industry? This book shows you how.</p> <p>In The Irresistible Offer, author and New Marketing guru Mark Joyner defines and explains this revolutionary selling philosophy, uses real case studies to show it in effect, and helps you quickly and easily apply it to your own business. He examines the elements that make up The Irresistible Offer and presents a formula for creating one of your own. Plus, Joyner provides practical tools that allow you to estimate the effectiveness of your offer in advance so you can plan accordingly.</p> <p>For too long, selling has been about manipulating a message and manipulating a consumer. The Irresistible Offer presents a new, effective, and ethical way to sell based on what you're selling, not how you're selling it. Rather than manipulate your customer (who may resent it, after all), Joyner shows you how to manipulate your offer instead&#x2014;so that customers find it, and your company, truly irresistible.</p>MARK JOYNER is a leading authority on Internet marketing and New Marketing.

It links in a unified presentation the Fourier transform, discrete Fourier transform, FFT, and fundamental applications of the FFT. The FFT is becoming a primary analytical tool in such diverse fields as linear systems, optics, probability theory, quantum physics, antennas, and signal analysis, but there has always been a problem of communicating its fundamentals. Thus the aim of this book is to provide a readable and functional treatment of the FFT and its significant applications. In his Preface the author explains the organization of his topics, &#34;... Every major concept is developed by a three-stage sequential process. First, the concept is introduced by an intuitive development which is usually pictorial and nature. Second, a non-sophisticated (but thoroughly sound) mathematical treatment is developed to support the intuitive arguments. The third stage consists of practical examples designed to review and expand the concept being discussed. It is felt that this three-step procedure gives meaning as well as mathematical substance to the basic properties of the FFT. --- from book&#39;s dustjacket</p><p></p><h2>Architectural Drafting and Design</h2><p>ARCHITECTURAL DRAFTING AND DESIGN, Seventh Edition, is the definitive text for beginning, intermediate, or advanced architectural CAD operators.

Murphy and his wife, Nancy, live in Boston.</p>Kindergarten-Grade 2AIn this math lesson in story form, four bear cubs gather nuts, then blueberries, and finally seeds for their mother's Blue Ribbon Blueberry Pie. All of the contents of their baskets are then placed in sets of 10; because only three did their fair share of the work, a tally of the ingredients shows that there aren't enough for the pie. Then the fourth little cub runs to collect everything and a recount, again in sets of 10s, shows that there are now enough nuts, berries, and seeds for mother's dessert. Each will get a fair bear share. The addition problems are clearly shown. Each bear's items are shown in numeral, pictorial, and word form, although the final addition is just in numeral form. A two-page appendix gives suggestions of more things to count in everyday life such as cars, crayons, kitchen supplies, and even trees and dogs. This seems a bit heavy-handed for the story, yet too slim for those needing an explanatory math text and practice. It will serve caregivers and teachers who need to kickstart their common-sense teaching skills.ANancy A.

But the ideas and attitudes that encourage the biological and medical sciences to experiment on living creatures date from the earliest expression of Western thought. In <i>Animal and Human Experimentation</i>, Anita Guerrini looks at the history of these practices from vivisection in ancient Alexandria to present-day battles over animal rights and medical research employing human subjects.</p><p>Guerrini discusses in-depth key historical episodes in the use of living beings in science and medicine, including the discovery of blood circulation, the development of smallpox and polio vaccines, and recent AIDS research. She also explores the rise of the antivivisection movement in Victorian England, the modern animal rights movement, and current debates over gene therapy. In this highly accessible text, we learn how our understanding of an animal's capacity to feel pain has evolved. Guerrini reminds us that the ethical values of science seldom stray far from those of the society in which scientists live and work. </p><p>Ethical questions about the use of animals and humans in research remain among the most vexing within both the scientific community and society at large. These often rancorous arguments have gone on, however, with little awareness of their historical antecedents. <i>Animal and Human Experimentation</i> offers students and concerned general readers on every side of this debate a context within which to understand more fully the responsibility we all bear for the suffering inflicted on other living beings in the name of scientific knowledge.</p></p><p><p><b>Anita Guerrini</b> is the Horning Professor in the Humanities and professor of history at Oregon State University, Corvallis.</p><p>" An excellent survey of human experimentation on both humans and animals.

K. Johnston was standing at the rostrum in a University of Missouri auditorium. The annual awards ceremony for the School of Journalism was in full swing. Best columnist, best sports writer, best feature writer&#x2014;each award winner was called up to the stage, where Professor Johnston shook his hand and said kind and appropriate words as he bestowed a trophy of recognition. The professor had been on the University of Missouri faculty since 1924 and was now fifty years old, a man distinguished and comfortable in middle age, dressed formally in a light summer suit, spectacles balanced low on the bridge of his nose.<br> <br>Professor Johnston had taken a place of honor on that stage because that academic year he&#x2019;d served as acting dean of the School of Journalism. The elderly permanent dean, Frank Mott, had been on leave, and Professor Johnston was an apt choice as his temporary replacement: E. K. Johnston was a full professor, he was much loved and respected by students and colleagues alike,1 and he had a national reputation as a multiterm president of a professional fraternity for those working in the relatively new discipline of the science of newspaper advertising.2 Indeed, it was assumed by many at the University of Missouri that when the present dean retired, Professor Johnston would be named his permanent successor.<br> <br>But as Professor Johnston was fulfilling his academic duties by shaking hands and wishing the aspiring young journalists continued success, he knew there was a warrant out for his arrest, issued by the county prosecutor.3 He suspected too that the charge against him was commission of sodomy. But for the moment, he wanted only to get through the awards ceremony&#x2014;to fulfill his last duty of the academic year to the students in his charge&#x2014;and he did.<br> <br>When the ceremony was over, Professor Johnston drove himself downtown, walked into the county prosecutor&#x2019;s office, and gave himself up. At his arraignment, he pleaded innocent. Thrown into the Boone County jail until he could raise bail, he spent two days behind bars.4<br> <br>The county prosecutor, Howard Lang, had started the investigation six months earlier. There&#x2019;d been a robbery, and a man was apprehended and brought in for questioning. It was he, Prosecutor Lang told the newspapers, who talked about a &#x201c;homosexual ring&#x201d; there in Columbia, Missouri, that carried on sex orgies. As happened often during police interrogations of homosexuals in the mid-twentieth century, police detectives grilled the robber until he named names. One of the names was Willie Coots, a thirty-nine-year-old gift shop employee. Coots was then brought in and was made to name more names. Each man that Willie Coots named was dragged in for questioning and grilled. A police department secretary took down in shorthand what each arrestee said, and she compiled a list of thirty names.5<br> <br>Of all the men Coots named, the most interesting to the Columbia police, because of his prominence, was Professor E. K. Johnston. Coots confessed that he and the professor had lived together for ten years as lovers and for the last six years as friends. The police wanted more facts. Had he and Johnston held homosexual parties in their shared apartment? Yes, they had. More names; other homosexuals who&#x2019;d had illegal congress with Johnston. Yes, he did remember some: just a few days earlier, there was a man named Warren Heathman. Heathman was a thirty-five-year-old World War II veteran who had fought overseas; he&#x2019;d earned a master&#x2019;s degree in agriculture from the University of Missouri and was now an instructor for the Veterans Administration&#x2019;s farm training program.<br> <br>Heathman could not be found at his home address, so the Columbia police sent out an all-points bulletin for his arrest. He was picked up by state highway patrolmen in Rolla, Missouri, about two hours away, and locked up overnight in Jefferson City&#x2019;s Cole County Jail. In the morning, patrolmen shackled him and drove him to the jail in Columbia, and he too was grilled. This was serious business, they told him. Perjury is a felony for which he could be incarcerated for five years. Willie Coots had mentioned a big fish: a professor at the university. Did Heathman know E. K. Johnston? When had he last seen him? Where?<br> <br>Heathman, disoriented and scared, did not take long to answer every question they threw at him. Yes, he and Johnston engaged in homosexual activities. Yes, on an average of every other week. Yes, usually in Johnston&#x2019;s apartment. Yes, he&#x2019;d been to homosexual parties not only in that same apartment but also at a cabin near Salem, Missouri. (&#x201c;Mad parties of a homosexual cabal,&#x201d; the newspapers would report.6) Just as Willie Coots had done, Heathman signed a statement implicating Johnston as the leader of the &#x201c;homosexual ring.&#x201d;<br> <br>Heathman and Coots both waived their preliminary hearings; they did not want to drag out their ordeal. Because neither one was the supposed kingpin of the &#x201c;homosexual ring,&#x201d; their bail was set at $2,500 apiece, $1,000 lower than Johnston&#x2019;s.7 The professor, however, was not as easily intimidated. He had gone himself to the police station and demanded to know why there was a warrant out for his arrest. When police detectives took him into a room to interrogate him, he knew his rights. He would say nothing to his inquisitors except &#x201c;I want to talk to my lawyer.&#x201d; He was permitted to call his attorney, Edwin Orr, who advised him not to sign any statement and not to waive his preliminary hearing.<br> <br>From the Boone County Jail, he contacted his half brother in Kansas City, and a friend in Sedalia, Missouri, and borrowed money for the $3,500 bond.8 In their coverage of the story, local newspapers were sure to name both Howard Johnston, the brother, and Fred Hildebrandt, the friend, shaming them for having aided and abetted a homosexual.<br> <br>Family newspapers within a thousand-mile radius of Columbia all seemed to pick up the story, which was covered by the wire services of the Associated Press as well as the United Press International. The local papers embellished their articles with sensational headlines. &#x201c;Missouri Professor Held for Sodomy: Termed Principal in Homosexual Ring&#x201d; was the Pottstown (PA) Mercury headline.9 The headline in Arkansas&#x2019;s Hope Star was simply &#x201c;Homosexual,&#x201d; which was shocking enough all by itself in 1948.10<br> <br>It was not until his temporary release from jail that Johnston learned that he&#x2019;d been found guilty even before he was tried. &#x201c;In view of the nature and gravity of the charges that have been made against Professor E. K. Johnston,&#x201d; the president of the university, Frederick Middlebush, told reporters, &#x201c;he has been relieved of his duties as a member of the university.&#x201d;11 Hysteria spread. The superintendent of the State Highway Patrol, Colonel Hugh Waggoner, announced not only to the university&#x2019;s board of curators but also to the media that Johnston was only the tip of the iceberg.12<br> <br>The board of curators panicked. Allen McReynolds, its president, immediately called a press conference to promise the public, &#x201c;The board will take such action as it deems necessary to protect the interests of the university.&#x201d; McReynolds added defensively that homosexuals were &#x201c;a public problem, and one that ought to be solved.&#x201d;13 Missouri&#x2019;s governor, Phil Donnelly, weighed in, assuring Missourians that he had ordered the president of the board of curators to confer with State Highway Patrol officials about the homosexuals they&#x2019;d discovered and to make sure such people had no place on the university&#x2019;s faculty or among the student body.14<br> <br>On November 17 Johnston stood before Judge W. M. Dinwiddie of the Boone County Circuit Court. Johnston&#x2019;s lawyer, Edwin Orr, had advised him that the prosecutor held in his hands multiple signed statements. He must throw himself at the mercy of the court. Johnston must have struggled to resign himself to this: How could he relinquish into perpetuity the image of the man he once was? How could he claim as his the character of a criminal? Orr promised that he would call witnesses who would talk about Johnston&#x2019;s good character and plead for clemency. The witnesses would tell the judge there was no point in sending a man like Johnston to jail. The ex-professor was by now emotionally and physically exhausted. He&#x2019;d lost his job, his good name, his beloved students, his entire career&#x2014;even his pension. He was fifty years old. What would he live on for the rest of his life? He had no more fight left in him. And if he did not confess to the world of being guilty of sodomy and then throw himself at Judge Dinwiddie&#x2019;s mercy, he would be locked in jail for who knew how many years to come.<br> <br>Johnston pleaded guilty and did not open his mouth again for the rest of the trial. The principal witness for the defense was Dr. Edward Gildea, head of the Department of Psychiatry at Washington University in Saint Louis. Asked whether E. K. Johnston would be a menace to society if he were placed on probation, the psychiatrist said no, &#x201c;though in my judgment he is a homosexual.&#x201d; He was followed by a long line of character witnesses. Each confirmed that Johnston had been widely respected and liked; that a penitentiary sentence would not help him nor serve society; that he could be turned free without detriment to society.15<br> <br>The pleas for clemency were not without effect. Judge Dinwiddie wouldn&#x2019;t send the defendant to jail, he announced. He&#x2019;d put him on probation for four years. Johnston must have felt a surge of relief, even joy. But the judge was not through. Johnston was required to post a $2,000 bond. It was his obligation to pay all court costs. Judge Dinwiddie ordered him to report regularly to Wayne Ballard, the state probation officer. Finally, Judge Dinwiddie concluded, &#x201c;Your order of probation includes your cessation of all homosexual practices.&#x201d;16<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>There&#x2019;s a Women&#x2019;s Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery. It was erected in 1997 to honor the two million women who have served in the American military, past and present. It sits on the grand four-acre ceremonial entrance; and its elegant structure, with its lofty classical design and its arced ceiling made of glass tablets, is worthy of the solemn site. There&#x2019;s also an auditorium at the Women&#x2019;s Memorial, where ceremonies are held to recognize the outstanding achievements of female military personnel. In that auditorium, army colonel Tammy Smith was pinned with two stars: one on each epaulet, making official her promotion to brigadier general. A ceremony that celebrates a woman&#x2019;s rise to the rank of general is certainly rare, though not unheard of: there&#x2019;d already been about fifty women generals or admirals serving in the US military. But the auditorium of the Women&#x2019;s Memorial had never yet seen quite such a ceremony as the one that took place on August 10, 2012.17<br> <br>At four o&#x2019;clock, as a soloist sang &#x201c;The Star Spangled Banner,&#x201d; Smith, a short, slight, bespectacled woman who&#x2019;d once been a senior parachutist and an airplane jump master, marched onto the stage together with her commanding officer, Major General Jack Stultz. Media cameras rolled and clicked. In General Stultz&#x2019;s ceremonial remarks he talked about why Smith had been promoted to her elevated position: she&#x2019;d racked up a fruit salad of medals in her distinguished twenty-six years of service in the army, which included a stint in Afghanistan as chief of army reserve affairs. General Stultz praised &#x201c;the values she epitomized&#x201d; and her ability as a leader. She is, he said, &#x201c;a quiet professional who just knows how to come in and take over.&#x201d;<br> <br>Then the general introduced the guests of honor: first Smith&#x2019;s elderly father and then her spouse and her in-laws. Traditionally, the stars on a new general&#x2019;s epaulets are pinned by the two individuals most meaningful to that person. Smith stood at attention while her father pinned on one side and her spouse pinned on the other. Her in-laws too had an official role in the ceremony: they were chosen to remove the colonel&#x2019;s shoulder boards from Smith&#x2019;s uniform and replace them with a general&#x2019;s shoulder boards. Next, father and spouse unfurled a flag&#x2014;red with a white star&#x2014;which is to be flown wherever Smith will be stationed to announce that a general is present.<br> <br>There was little about this traditional ceremony that was unique&#x2014;except that the spouse, Tracey Hepner, was a woman. It was a brave act, not because Smith might be in danger of discharge or losing her new rank, but because never before in the entire history of the US military had it been done.<br> <br>Smith had told General Stultz well in advance that she wanted her wife to be part of the pinning ceremony. &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t blink an eye,&#x201d; she recalled; nor did the Department of Defense. &#x201c;This is your story. It&#x2019;s a good story. Don&#x2019;t be afraid to tell it,&#x201d; DOD officials said in encouraging her to respond to media requests for interviews about the inclusion of her wife in her promotion ceremony. &#x201c;Tell them why it&#x2019;s important to have Tracey pin your star. Tell them what it means to you.&#x201d;18<br> <br>What it meant, General Smith told the media, was that finally, with the repeal of &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t Ask, Don&#x2019;t Tell,&#x201d; she was able to feel &#x201c;full, authentic, and complete&#x201d; by no longer having to keep secret who she was. She had no desire to grandstand&#x2014;to make political &#x201c;coming-out&#x201d; declarations. Her wife&#x2019;s prominent role in the ceremony was Smith&#x2019;s clear and simple statement that &#x201c;this is my family.&#x201d; Since Don&#x2019;t Ask, Don&#x2019;t Tell has been overturned, sexual orientation is considered a private matter by the Department of Defense. It&#x2019;s a private matter for General Smith as well&#x2014;but, she said, participating with family in traditional ceremonies, such as the pinning ceremony, is both common and expected of a leader. By including her wife, she was doing no more and no less than what military leaders have always done at such ceremonies.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>What long-fought battles, tragic losses, and hard-won triumphs have brought us as a country from the days when a much-loved and gifted professor could be disgraced, thrown in jail, and hounded out of his profession as soon as his private life was revealed, to the days when a military officer could marry the woman she loves in broad daylight and be promoted, in a very public ceremony, to the rank of general with her wife by her side? How does the amazing evolution in image and status of gays and lesbians, as well as bisexual and transgender people, affect all Americans?

Immensely influential among the Beat writers of the 1950s -- notably Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg -- he already had an underground reputation before the appearance of his first important book, &#39;Naked Lunch&#39;. Originally published by the daring and influential Olympia Press (the original publishers of Henry Miller) in France in 1959, it aroused great controversy on publication and was not available in the US until 1962 and in the UK until 1964. The book was adapted for film by David Cronenberg in 1991.&#39;A true genius and first mythographer of the mid-twentieth century, William Burroughs is the lineal successor to James Joyce. &#34;Naked Lunch&#34; is a banquet you will never forget.&#39; JG Ballard &#39;Prophesied with unerring accuracy the hideous modes that human behaviour would assume in the post-apocalyptic second half of the twentieth century. &#34;Naked Lunch&#34; is essential reading for anyone who maintains any illusions about anything.&#39; Will Self &#39;William Burroughs broadened people&#39;s conception of what makes humanity. In that way, he really was an American hero, a hero writer, and also just a great man.&#39; Lou Reed &#39;A delirious exploration of sexual violence through the art of collage.&#39; Time Out</p><h2>Davis's Comprehensive Handbook of Laboratory &amp; Diagnostic Tests With Nursing Implications</h2><p><ul><br> <li>Fast Find: Lab and Dx&#x2014;The complete F.A.

In this timely book, Anatol Lieven presents an intimate and engaging portrait of the history and culture of the Baltic states from their ancient origins to their contemporary status. He explores the culture and personality of the Baltic peoples, their religious and racial differences, their relations with Russia and with the West, and their prospects for the future. <br><br>Lieven begins by describing the ancient Baltic peoples, their conquest by the Christians, the evolution of the Lithuanian empire and their union with Poland, and the experience of the Baltic provinces under the Russian Empire. He then looks at the countries' first struggle for independence in 1918, the failure of democracy and the establishment of authoritarian regimes, and the Soviet annexation of the Baltic in 1940. Lieven discusses the class structure of the Baltics and the ethnic tensions that have existed between the Germans, Jews, Poles, and Russians who live there. Drawing on a wide range of sources including interviews, newspaper accounts, and his own observations, he describes and analyzes the rise of national movements in each of the three countries after Glastnost. He concludes by discussing the new constitutions and the elections of 1992, the current forces of order, the demolition of the Soviet economies, and the possibilities for democracy and Europeanization or for ethnic conflict and nationalist dictatorship.</p><p>In this subtle, penetrating study, Anatol Lieven presents an intimate and engaging portrait of the history, culture and politics of the Baltic States from their ancient origins to their contemporary status.</p><h2>The Scarlet Letter (Ignatius Critical Editions)</h2><p>A key figure in the development of American literature, Nathaniel Hawthorne was also profoundly influenced by his ancestors and the Christianity that underscored their Puritan heritage.

In this much-anticipated <strong>Fifth Edition</strong> of <strong>Unorthodox Lawmaking</strong>, Sinclair explores the full range of special procedures and processes that make up Congress&#x2019;s work, as well as the reasons these unconventional routes evolved. The author introduces students to the intricacies of Congress and provides the tools to assess the relative successes and limitations of the institution.<br> <br> This dramatically updated revision incorporates a wealth of new cases and examples to illustrate the changes occurring in congressional process. Two entirely new case study chapters&#x2015;on the 2013 government shutdown and the 2015 reauthorization of the Patriot Act&#x2015;highlight Sinclair&#x2019;s fresh analysis and the book is now introduced by a new foreword from noted scholar and teacher, Bruce I. Oppenheimer, reflecting on this book and Barbara Sinclair&#x2019;s significant mark on the study of Congress.</p><p><p> <b>Barbara Sinclair</b> is Marvin Hoffenberg Professor of American Politics at the University of California at Los Angeles.

Fenno Prize and the D. B. Hardeman Prize, and <i>Party Wars: Polarization and the Politics of National Policy Making.</i></p>"<strong>Unorthodox Lawmaking</strong> does an excellent job of synthesizing the legislative process in each chamber. I have not found another book on the market that so clearly addresses the differences like this one does." Author: Sophia Wallace<br><br>"<strong>Unorthodox Lawmaking</strong> is a superb foundational text, exploring well-researched variations in lawmaking in ways that are not typically found in other academic resources. It is one of the best examinations of legislative practices available the academic market. Sinclair uses robust research to uncover and analyze the complexities of lawmaking in comprehensible ways. This text is a go-to resource for information about U.S. legislative practices." Author: Ren�e B. Van Vechten<br><br>"Barbara Sinclair does an excellent job of showing how contemporary lawmaking departs from the traditional legislative process. I can&#x2032;t imagine teaching a course on Congress without this text&#x2015;it&#x2019;s absolutely indispensable." Author: Philip Klinkner<br><br>"<strong>Unorthodox Lawmaking</strong> does a great job of using contemporary examples to provide an in-depth look at the complicated and highly politicized process that defines how a bill becomes a law in modern Congress." Author: Michael Lynch<br><br>"<strong>Unorthodox Lawmaking</strong> puts the transformation of the lawmaking process in Congress into context, documenting specific changes that have occurred and providing an argument for precisely why they took place. Sinclair illustrates the use of these new techniques in a way that keeps students interested." Author: Vincent Moscardelli<br><br>"<strong>Unorthodox Lawmaking </strong>is a great read, with a strong foundation about Congress as an institution. Sinclair strikes a balance between general statements and nuance, and demonstrates how complicated the policy process has become. Yet she doesn&#x2032;t leave the reader without some general take-away points about how the process deviates from traditional textbook explanations." Author: Maryann Gallagher<br><br>"My students have enjoyed reading <strong>Unorthodox Lawmaking</strong> more than most of the other assigned texts. Sinclair&#x2019;s writing makes the material approachable and helps precipitate lively discussions." Author: James Wallner<br><br>"The concept and content of <strong>Unorthodox Lawmaking</strong> from the very beginning is well done. Sinclair&#x2019;s use of case studies to illustrate the shift from &#x2018;traditional&#x2019; to &#x2018;unorthodox&#x2019; processes is impressive." Author: Carl Cavalli<br><br>"<strong>Unorthodox Lawmaking</strong> is straightforward and to-the-point. Sinclair does an excellent job of covering the primary topics, and the examples of unorthodox lawmaking are equally as good. I have used this text myself since reading the second edition."

Indeed, many wonder if Vermeer employed a camera obscura, a primitive form of camera, to enhance his realistic effects?<br> In <em>Vermeer's Camera</em>, Philip Steadman traces the development of the camera obscura--first described by Leonaro da Vinci--weighs the arguments that scholars have made for and against Vermeer's use of the camera, and offers a fascinating examination of the paintings themselves and what they alone can tell us of Vermeer's technique. Vermeer left no record of his method and indeed we know almost nothing of the man nor of how he worked. But by a close and illuminating study of the paintings Steadman concludes that Vermeer did use the camera obscura and shows how the inherent defects in this primitive device enabled Vermeer to achieve some remarkable effects--the slight blurring of image, the absence of sharp lines, the peculiar illusion not of closeness but of distance in the domestic scenes. Steadman argues that the use of the camera also explains some previously unexplainable qualities of Vermeer's art, such as the absence of conventional drawing, the pattern of underpainting in areas of pure tone, the pervasive feeling of reticence that suffuses his canvases, and the almost magical sense that Vermeer is painting not objects but light itself. <br> Drawing on a wealth of Vermeer research and displaying an extraordinary sensitivity to the subtleties of the work itself, Philip Steadman offers in <em>Vermeer's Camera</em> a fresh perspective on some of the most enchanting paintings ever created.</p><p>Philip Steadman's remarkable book <i>Vermeer's Camera</i> cracks an artistic enigma that has haunted art history for centuries. Over the years, artists and art historians have marveled at the extraordinary visual realism of the paintings of the 17th-century Dutch painter Jan Vermeer. The painter's spectacular <i>View of Delft</i>, painted around 1661, and the beautiful domestic interior <i>The Music Lesson</i> seem almost photographic in their incredible detail and precise perspective. Since the 19th century, experts have speculated that Vermeer used a camera obscura, an early precursor of the modern camera. However, conclusive proof was never discovered, until now. In <i>Vermeer's Camera</i>, Steadman proves that Vermeer did indeed use a camera obscura to complete his greatest canvases. Part art-historical study, part scientific argument, but mainly a fascinating detective story, <i>Vermeer's Camera</i> argues: <blockquote>Vermeer had a camera obscura with a lens at the painting's viewpoint. He used this arrangement to project the scene onto the back wall of the room, which thus served as the camera's screen. He put paper on the wall and traced, perhaps even painted from the projected image. It is because Vermeer traced these images that they are the same size as the paintings themselves.</blockquote> Steadman painstakingly develops his argument through careful study of the history of the camera obscura, an exploration of 17th-century optics, and a detailed study of the light, optics, perspective, and measurement of a series of Vermeer's paintings. He goes to remarkable lengths to reconstruct Vermeer's studio and its furnishings, down to the angle of the light from its windows. The science is complex, but always clearly explained. This is not an attempt to reveal Vermeer as an artistic "cheat." Steadman convincingly argues that "Vermeer's obsessions with light, tonal values, shadow, and colour, for the treatment of which his work is so admired, are very closely bound up with his study of the special qualities of optical images." <i>Vermeer's Camera</i> is a wonderful book that shows the ways in which, during the 17th century, art and science went hand in hand. It offers an enlarged, rather than reduced, perspective on Vermeer. <i>--Jerry Brotton. Amazon.co.uk</i>Controversy about Vermeer's use of the camera obscura <p>The suggestion that Vermeer might have employed some optical device as an aid to painting is more than a hundred years old. From the 1890s up to the 1980s a broad consensus built amongst Vermeer scholars, that the artist seems likely to have made use of the camera obscura - though the exact details of this technique remained uncertain. The notion was investigated experimentally by Seymour, Fink and Wheelock. Meanwhile the implications for Vermeer's style were explored by several critics, outstanding among them the poet Paul Claudel, the painter Lawrence Gowing in his monograph on Vermeer of 1952, and the historian Svetlana Alpers in The Art of Describing (1983). There were dissenting voices, certainly - as for example Swillens, who argued that Vermeer used geometrical perspective methods - and other critics for whom the issue was unimportant. But the majority view supported the idea that Vermeer was a camera user. </p><p>In the 1990s this consensus was broken. The catalogue of the big Vermeer exhibition held in Washington and The Hague in 1995/96 mentioned the camera briefly, but claimed that Vermeer 'did not trace the image' directly. Much more space was devoted to an article by J�rgen Wadum, curator at The Hague, proposing that the artist relied instead on conventional mathematical perspective procedures. Since then several authors have been quite insistent that Vermeer did not use the camera. For example a volume of Vermeer Studies, published by Yale in 1998, contained an article on the camera obscura by Jean-Luc Delsaute, who concluded: "it seems rash to continue to believe that the camera was one of the tools with which [Vermeer] worked." </p><p>The position of Arthur Wheelock, principal curator of the 1995/96 exhibition, and author of many books on Vermeer, appears to have evolved. In his doctoral thesis of 1973 he was enthusiastic about the camera theory. More recently he seems to have become dubious, believing that although Vermeer might have been familiar with the instrument, and might even have mimicked its effects on occasion, he certainly did not trace large parts of his paintings from camera images. Instead he set up his perspectives, Wheelock believes, in the same way as contemporary Dutch architectural painters: ' a rough sketch, a construction drawing and then the final composition.' </p><p>This scepticism seems to arise out of distaste for the very idea that Vermeer might have been guilty of what is still regarded as a form of cheating. (Vermeer's Camera argues that this view is misplaced and historically irrelevant in the case of Vermeer.) Another reason for doubt is that most previous arguments for Vermeer's use of the camera have been founded on minor idiosyncrasies of his painting style. Otherwise the use of the instrument would have left no obvious trace. No documentary evidence of any kind survives about Vermeer's working methods, no drawings from his hand, no clear-cut results from x-ray analysis of the canvases. Thus it has been difficult to reach definite conclusions. </p><p>Vermeer's Camera takes a wholly new approach to the issue, via the geometrical structure of Vermeer's pictures of domestic interiors. Through this route it is possible to reconstruct, with great precision, the architecture of the room in which Vermeer set as many as a dozen of his compositions, and to confirm that he depicts real pieces of furniture, real maps and real paintings - all of which survive today - at their actual known sizes. The central finding of the book is that the projected images, on the back wall of at least six of Vermeer's views of this room, are the exact same sizes as the canvases themselves. It is very difficult to explain this result, other than as powerful evidence of Vermeer tracing these images in a camera obscura. The fact that the arguments of the book are geometrical ones, about unarguable, measurable properties of the paintings themselves, gives them a special force. </p><p>The geometrical results cannot easily be accounted for by the idea that Vermeer worked, not optically, but mathematically. Indeed Vermeer's Camera demonstrates that, although it is plausible in itself that Vermeer might have used textbook perspective methods, there is no positive evidence for this proposition (not even the presence of tiny pinholes at the perspective 'vanishing points', as some authors including Wadum have argued). </p><p>Philip Steadman, January 2001</p></p><h2>BSCS Biology: A Molecular Approach, Student Edition</h2><p><b>A comprehensive, inquiry-based approach to biology</b><br><br><i><b>BSCS Biology: A Molecular Approach (Blue Version)</b></i> challenges gifted and honor students to think scientifically, to integrate concepts, to analyze data, and to explore complex issues.

The only species counterpoint text that draws directly on Renaissance treatises, it provides a conceptual framework to guide students through composition and analysis as it teaches them general structural principles. With stylistically diverse examples including not only motets and mass movements but also French chansons, German chorale settings, English canzonets, Italian madrigals, and Spanish organ hymns, villancicos, and ricercars, the book gives students a "real-life" feel for the subject. It distinguishes between technical requirements ("hard" rules) and stylistic guidelines ("soft" rules), and includes coordinated exercises that allow students to develop their skills systematically. The concluding chapters provide the formal and conceptual building blocks for longer pieces and encourage students to understand analysis and composition as complementary activities. By the end of the book, they are writing real compositions, not just drill exercises. <br> <em>Modal Counterpoint, Renaissance Style</em> features carefully chosen contemporaneous musical examples, progressively graded exercises, historical asides that explain important topics and issues of the period, and a set of notes to the instructor. Combining the historical accuracy of "style-oriented" texts with the more systematic species counterpoint approach, this book offers a unique alternative to other methods.</p><p>Peter Schubert is at McGill University."The finest introduction to modal counterpoint in the Renaissance style that I know....The author's approach is logical, and students are introduced to the potentially difficult subject beginning with fundamentals and advancing step by step to more complex issues and problems. Consequently, an<br>instructor with only a limited amount of time to devote to an introduction to modal counterpoint could use the opening chapters of the book by themselves; the book is written so clearly that interested students could continue the work on their own. What distinguishes this book most from other<br>counterpoint texts is the author's capturing the Renaissance sense of 'play' at the heart of the musical composition of the time." --Jan Herlinger, Professor of Musicology, Louisiana State University<br><br>"Good basic text for undergraduates."--Robert L. Kendrick, University of Chicago<br><br>"Excellent text. Schubert's system of hard-soft 'rules' makes this a wonderful book. It includes many great assignments and the emphasis beyond traditional species is excellent."--Frank Felice, Butler University</p><h2>Intermediate Reader of Modern Chinese: Volume I: Text: Volume II: Vocabulary, Sentence Patterns, Exercises</h2><p><p>This textbook, prepared for American students who have already completed two semesters of Chinese, does not "talk down" to the student, and its contemporary subject matter will provoke classroom discussion.

Sims&#x2019;s <em>On Call in the Arctic</em>, where the author relates his incredible experience saving lives in one of the most remote outposts in North America.</p><p>Imagine a young doctor, trained in the latest medical knowledge and state-of-the-art equipment, suddenly transported back to one of the world&#x2019;s most isolated and unforgiving environments&#x2015;Nome, Alaska. Dr. Sims&#x2019; plans to become a pediatric surgeon drastically changed when, on the eve of being drafted into the Army to serve as a M.A.S.H. surgeon in Vietnam, he was offered a commission in the U.S. Public Health for assignment in Anchorage, Alaska.</p><p>In Anchorage, Dr. Sims was scheduled to act as Chief of Pediatrics at the Alaska Native Medical Center. Life changed, along with his military orders, when he learned he was being transferred from Anchorage to work as the only physician in Nome.&nbsp; There, he would have the awesome responsibility of rendering medical care under archaic conditions to the population of this frontier town plus thirteen Eskimo villages in the surrounding Norton Sound area. And he would do it alone with little help and support. All the while, he was pegged as both an &#x201c;outsider&#x201d; and an employee of the much-derided federal government.</p><p>In order to do his job, Dr. Sims had to overcome racism, cultural prejudices, and hostility from those who would like to see him sent packing. <em>On Call in the Arctic</em> reveals the thrills and the terrors of frontier medicine, where Dr. Sims must rely upon his instincts, improvise, and persevere against all odds in order to help his patients on the icy shores of the Bering Sea.&nbsp;</p> 16 pages of color photographs</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I decided to become a doctor on a Sunday afternoon. It was the day a family friend, an RN, slipped the tips of her stethoscope in my ears, its bell on her chest, and for the first time in my life I heard the sounds of a living human heart. I was mesmerized by the rhythmic beats, seventy pulses a minute I counted on my fingers, and captivated by notions of blood flowing through arteries and veins, giving life to every part of her body. I was ten years old at the time.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Life happened, and when it did, chances of achieving my dream seemed to slip away. I was born into a family burdened with addictions and had to accept the fact the best hope I could have for&nbsp;my&nbsp;life was to avoid the path taken by my parents and one of my brothers. Yet, despite odds against it, and by the grace of God, I adapted. I successfully made it through college at a major university, medical school, and internship to earn my degree.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; At age twenty-six, on the cusp of launching my dream career as a pediatric surgeon, disaster struck. I fell victim to a war nobody wanted and was overtaken by circumstances beyond my control. With a pregnant wife on the verge of delivery and a two-year-old daughter, I was pulled out of my medical training and buried into the remote, frozen wasteland of arctic Alaska. There, to serve as the only physician for over 10,000 people as an officer in the U.S. Public Health Service, I was abandoned in a desolate wilderness, left to provide a home for my family and perform feats of medicine and surgery far beyond my level of training or experience.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At first, I was paralyzed with fear. How could I practice medicine in ways I was never trained? How could I be a father and husband, living in a land so foreign to the life my wife and I had always known? I wanted nothing more than to crawl into a hole and hide.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Necessity and commitment didn't allow me the luxury of slipping away. Overnight, I was forced to adjust to overwhelming need, archaic facilities, and an unbelievably harsh environment. I had to practice medicine like I never thought possible. I had to learn to be flexible when my training in conventional medicine failed to show me the right decisions to make; to improvise when medical need demanded far more than I was emotionally and physically equipped to deliver; and to stick with my instincts and persevere until problems and situations were brought under control.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Be flexible, improvise, and persevere. The actions were familiar; they were those same principles I used as a child to adapt. They would now be the ones that would guide me through these most demanding of times.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Life and medical practice in the Arctic was severe - isolated, bittersweet, unpredictable, yet filled with laughter and tears. And I adapted to unforgiving living conditions, impossible medical situations and perilous travel, all to deliver frontier medicine and surgery far beyond what I ever believed myself capable. It was never a question of whether or not I wanted to do it. It was a question of whether or not I could succeed.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Writing "On Call in the Arctic" was an emotional rollercoaster ride through a time in my life I once felt I'd never want to revisit. Delivering my own son was an experience I will never forget, yet delivering other babies in remote Eskimo villages under Coleman lantern, performing surgery I was never taught to perform and required to do it without adequate anesthesia and under flashlight illumination, even traveling over a frozen ocean tied to the top of boxes piled on top a snowmobile sled and towed behind a broken down Ski-Doo were experiences I thought best left to my own private memories.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; But, with the passage of time, I began to realize the life and work adventures I had in the Arctic made me the man and physician I am today and I'm grateful for every life tingling experience I had there.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; My hope is that readers of my book will come to understand how the ability to improvise, be flexible and to persevere allowed me to achieve medical success far beyond what I ever dreamed myself possible, and how they can use those same principles in their own lives to achieve success beyond their wildest dreams no matter where they live or where their life path takes them.Advance Praise for "On Call in the Arctic"<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Entertaining and insightful.

The surprising truth revealed in <em>The Stranger in the Mirror,</em> a groundbreaking book based on eighteen years of pioneering research, is that millions of people have dissociative symptoms that have gone undetected or untreated. This hidden epidemic has occurred simply because people have been unable to identify their problem, or were not asked the right questions about their symptoms. Since dissociation can be a person 's standard response to trauma, its symptoms are a common reaction to such life--threatening events as a car accident or such intense, lasting traumas as rape. There is a strong possibility that you or someone you know suffers from some dissociative condition. Because dissociative experiences are often illusive and hard to describe, they are rarely reported to therapists.</p><p><em>The Stranger in the Mirror </em>offers the general public unique guidelines for identifying dissociative symptoms, as well as for treatment and recovery. It not only debunks many myths surrounding dissociation but also offers some startling revelations. For example, normal people experience dissociative symptoms in everyday life, and dissociation is as widespread as anxiety and depression and may explain such intriguing phenomena as past lives and near-death or out-of-body experiences.</p><p>Based on rigorous scientific testing, Dr. Marlene Steinberg has developed a breakthrough diagnostic tool for dissociation, one embraced by the mental health community as the "gold standard." The book's questionnaires, based on this test, will help you identify your own dissociative symptoms and will alert you to possible underlying dissociative causes of such pervasive conditions as anxiety, depression, manic-depression, attention-deficit hyper-activity disorder (ADRD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or even schizophrenia. If you have concerns about your own or a loved one's psychological health, this is a must-read book.</p><p>Filled with gripping and moving case histories of people with multiple personality or other dissociative conditions, <em>The Stranger in the Mirror</em> will take you behind the closed doors of the psychiatrist's office on a fascinating journey through the therapeutic process, providing enlightening insights into how all of us respond to trauma and overcome it. The innovative method of treatment described in this important book--the "Four C's," comfort, communication, cooperation, and connection--can benefit anyone in search of a healthier sense of self and a heightened capacity for joy.</p></p><p><p>Marlene Steinberg, M.D., is a practicing psychiatrist and world renowned researcher in dissociation. Dr. Steinberg conducted her pioneering research at Yale University School of Medicine. She practices in Connecticut and western Massachusetts.</p><br><br>Maxine Schnall a Pulitzer Prize nominee, is a former contributing editor to <em>Woman's Day</em> and the author of five books.What do the Columbine killings, "getting lost in a good book" and your midlife crisis have in common? According to psychiatrist Steinberg, they are all events that can be placed on a broad continuum of behaviors related to dissociative identity disorder, popularly known as multiple personality. Steinberg, whose research was supported with grants from the National Institute of Mental Health, argues with conviction that mild dissociative behaviorAtemporary episodes of disconnection or memory lossAcan be a useful mechanism for coping with such mundane but stressful events as giving public presentations as well as major traumas like an operation or an assault. In more extreme forms, it is a debilitating disorderAsimilar, she argues, to attention deficit disorderAthat is in need of psychiatric recognition and intervention. Arguing that DID often results from early childhood abuse, Steinberg passionately calls for removing the stigma from its related behaviors, noting that the popular conception of the disorder is gleaned from overblown films such as Sybil and The Three Faces of Eve. Readers can gauge their own dissociative tendencies with the book's abridged version of the Steinberg clinical interview for DSM-IV dissociative disorders. Readers interested in clinical depression and ADD will gravitate to this book, although Steinberg's throwaway comments that suggest that seeing "alternative" lifestyles depicted on TV can cause psychic confusion and that stepparents have a greater tendency to violate the incest prohibition may cost her some otherwise sympathetic readers. While DID doesn't have as much cultural currency as ADD, Steinberg's research has much to add to the contentious debates surrounding childhood trauma, diagnostic categories and the changing relationship between incurable disease and manageable disorder.

The noted astronomer James Kaler takes us on a tour of the 100 most interesting stars, describing their characteristics and importance in words and vivid pictures. James B. Kaler is an internationally recognized expert on stars and their formation. A professor of astronomy at the University of Illinois, he is the author of &#34;Stars and Their Spectra&#34; (Cambridge), &#34;Stars&#34; (Freeman/Scientific American Library), &#34;Cosmic Clouds&#34; (Freeman/Scientific American Library), and numerous articles for popular and professional astronomy magazines.</p><p>When we look into the night sky, thousands of stars twinkle back at us. We see cool red stars, hot blue stars, big stars and small stars. We find young stars and old stars, single stars and doubles. Some are astonishingly bright, while others hardly shine at all. Consider some examples from this book: <p>- Rapid rotators like the Black Widow, which spins 640 times per second, and speedsters like Barnard's Star, which clips along at 90 kilometers per second. </p><p>- Dazzling stars like Canopus, which shines 14,800 times more brightly than the Sun, and black holes like Cygnus X-1, with gravity so strong that no light at all escapes it. </p><p>- White dwarfs like EG 129, which has a magnetic field over a billion times stronger than Earth's. </p><p>- Young stars like T Tauri, just forming and accreting mass, and older stars like Eta Carinae that have exploded and are ejecting mass back into the Universe. </p><p>- Tiny neutron stars like Geminga, just 30 kilometers across, and enormous stars like VV Cephei, which is nearly as large as the entire orbit of Saturn. </p><p>The variety is astounding, even a bit overwhelming. How can the nascent stargazer begin to understand all the cosmos has to offer? In THE HUNDRED GREATEST STARS, James B. Kaler paints intimate portraits of the 100 stars he likes best. With an infectious enthusiasm, Kaler tells us about his favorites and, in the process, shows us how each star fits into the development and evolution of the cosmos.</p>James B. Kaler is Professor of Astronomy at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He has held both Fulbright and Guggenheim Fellowships, and has been awarded medals for his work from the University of Li�ge, Belgium, and the University of Mexico. Kaler is the author of dozens of articles and ten books, including THE LITTLE BOOK OF STARS (Copernicus Books) and EXTREME STARS: AT THE EDGE OF CREATION (Cambridge University Press). He also directs and maintains several educational websites, including the highly regarded and award-winning &#34;Stars of the Week&#34; site at the University of Illinois.</p><h2>Almost A Miracle: The American Victory in the War of Independence</h2><p>In this gripping chronicle of America's struggle for independence, award-winning historian John Ferling transports readers to the grim realities of that war, capturing an eight-year conflict filled with heroism, suffering, cowardice, betrayal, and fierce dedication. As Ferling demonstrates, it was a war that America came much closer to losing than is now usually remembered. General George Washington put it best when he said that the American victory was "little short of a standing miracle."<br><br><em>Almost a Miracle</em> offers an illuminating portrait of America's triumph, offering vivid descriptions of all the major engagements, from the first shots fired on Lexington Green to the surrender of General Cornwallis at Yorktown, revealing how these battles often hinged on intangibles such as leadership under fire, heroism, good fortune, blunders, tenacity, and surprise. Ferling paints sharp-eyed portraits of the key figures in the war, including General Washington and other American officers and civilian leaders. Some do not always measure up to their iconic reputations, including Washington himself. The book also examines the many faceless men who soldiered, often for years on end, braving untold dangers and enduring abounding miseries. The author explains why they served and sacrificed, and sees them as the forgotten heroes who won American independence.<br></p><p><br><strong>John Ferling</strong> brings to this book nearly forty years of experience as a historian of early America. He is the author of nine books and numerous articles on the American Revolution and early American wars, and has appeared in four television documentaries devoted to the Revolution and the War of Independence. His book <em>A Leap in the Dark</em> won the Fraunces Tavern Book Award as the year's best book on the American Revolution. He and his wife live in metropolitan Atlanta.<br>Reviewed by Jon Meacham In late 1779, John Adams, then America's "minister plenipotentiary for peace," set out across the Atlantic for France. It was a difficult moment. The Revolution was turning into a long war. It had been more than four years since Lexington and Concord and three since the Declaration of Independence; the American forces and their French allies had just lost an important engagement in Savannah. Adams had much to do, and his journey marked the beginning of yet another lengthy separation from Abigail. Sacrifices, however, were necessary, Adams said, adding: "We shall be happy, whenever our Country is so."<p>But as John Ferling makes clear in Almost a Miracle, his comprehensive and engaging new history of the Revolution, that day of national happiness was nowhere near. Ferling's book is a sprawling account of the military side of the war, an oft-told story that still rarely fails to engage. The American victory, as Wellington said of Waterloo, was a close-run thing, and the details of the clash of the world's mightiest empire with a guerrilla force of rebels remain compelling. Ferling's own attitude, recounted in his preface, is a common one: "I find the lure of the War of Independence to be ever more irresistible. It was war on a grand scale. Near its end, John Adams remarked that the American Revolution had set the world ablaze, and indeed the War of Independence grew to be a world war, with men fighting from Florida to Canada, from the Caribbean to Africa to India, and across broad reaches of high seas." Grand stuff and sweeping themes. But reading the book now, in the fifth summer of another American war in a very different century, one is also struck by the echo, however faint, of how asymmetrical warfare waged by native peoples can bedevil even the finest professional soldiers.</p><p>The rebels had honed their unconventional tactics long before the Revolution, mostly in combat against Native Americans. "The colonists learned how to minimize the chances of an enemy ambush, sometimes employed a hit-and-run style of fighting, often utilized a mobile strategy, and not infrequently adopted terror tactics that included torture; killing women, children, and the elderly; the destruction of Indian villages and food supplies. . . . In time, warfare in the colonies came to be associated with a manner of fighting that England's career soldiers variously called 'irregular war,' 'bush war,' or simply the 'American way of war.' " There was also a clash of cultures between the independent-minded Americans and the haughtier British officers in the years leading up to the Revolution; there were scourges and beatings and hangings.</p><p>The combustible intersection of brute tactics, the Brits' resentment of their rebellious colonialists, and the fury many Americans felt at their London masters turned the Revolution into a grim and bloody conflict even by the standards of warfare. In South Carolina, for example, there was what Ferling calls "a saturnalia of bloodshed" at the Waxhaws crossroads (home of the young Andrew Jackson), a massacre of "severed hands and limbs, crushed skulls, and breached arteries. Some men were decapitated by the slashing cavalrymen. Others were trampled by maddened horses. The bellies of many were laid open by bayonets." The victims were Americans, and for years the rebels could only scrape by; George Washington spent a lot of time, Ferling notes, putting "a rosy face on . . . defeat, a skill that he had perfected."</p><p>The decisive moment came not where the Revolution was born (in the North) but in the hot, distant fields of the South. Ferling is particularly strong in recreating the relentless misery of the war in Georgia and the Carolinas, an essential theater that is overlooked in many popular recountings. The gradual colonial successes in the Carolinas were crucial to the ultimate victory; it was Nathaniel Greene's satisfaction with a battle at Eutaw Springs, S.C., that led him, in September 1781, to think that perhaps, just perhaps, "this cruel war" might "end gloriously" for the rebels.</p><p>He was right. The British failure to subdue the region (they were driven to Savannah and Charleston, coastal outposts) was almost immediately followed by what turned out to be the final showdown at Yorktown, Va., in October 1781. George Washington was surprised to receive a note from Cornwallis requesting a ceasefire so that the British might sue for peace; as Ferling points out, no one in the whole choppy history of the war had ever surrendered to Washington before.</p><p>The guns silent, word of Cornwallis's capitulation spread rapidly. As a dispatch rider galloped north with the news, a 15-year-old Virginia militiaman guarding prisoners near the Appomattox River recalled that "every American present" threw "his cocked hat up in the air," shouting, "America is ours." In London, Lord North, the prime minister, paced and muttered, "Oh God, it is all over!" And in Philadelphia, Congress processed to a Lutheran Church to give thanks to God and pray for a sound peace. The people, as John Adams had hoped, were as happy as their country.</p><p>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

The most striking merits of Guthrie&#39;s work are his mastery of a tremendous range of ancient literature and modern scholarship, his fairness and balance of judgement and the lucidity and precision of his English prose. He has achieved clarity and comprehensiveness.</p><p>In the second volume of his History of Greek Philosophy Professor Guthrie completes his study of the Presocratic tradition. He groups together families of philosophers who were interested in the same things, distinguishing particularly between the natural philosopher, with their primary interest in cosmogony and the nature of matter, and the moral philosopher with their absorption in human nature and in problems of individual and social morality.</p><h2>Wheelock&#39;s Latin (Harpercollins College Outline)</h2><p>The classic single-volume introductory Latin textbook, revised and updated for today&#39;s students.</p><p><p>Frederic M.

The influence of the notorious Harmon inheritance ripples through a large cast of vividly drawn characters from every level of society, including Noddy Boffin, known as &#x201c;the Golden Dustman&#x201d;; the one-legged villain Silas Wegg; willful Bella Wilfer; saintly Lizzie Hexam; the sharp-witted doll&#x2019;s dressmaker Jenny Wren; the social-climbing Veneerings; the ruthless speculator Fascination Fledgeby; and the river-scavenging corpse robbers Gaffer Hexam and Rogue Riderhood. Out of this flurry of invention Dickens creates in <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> a portrait of a city and a civilization that is at once indignant, compassionate, and utterly unforgettable.<br><br>Charles Dickens&#x2019;s last completed novel features one of his most surreal and haunting visions of &nbsp;London, shadowed by towering dust heaps that supply the corrupting riches at the heart of the plot and washed by the dark river that winds its way insistently through the story.<br><br>This edition reprints the original Everyman&#x2019;s preface by G. K. Chesterton and features forty illustrations by Marcus Stone.</p></p><p><i>Our Mutual Friend</i> was the last novel Charles Dickens completed and is, arguably, his darkest and most complex. The basic plot is vintage Dickens: an inheritance up for grabs, a murder, a rocky romance or two, plenty of skullduggery, and a host of unforgettable secondary characters. But in this final outing the author's heroes are more flawed, his villains more sympathetic, and the story as a whole more harrowing and less sentimental. The mood is set in the opening scene in which a riverman, Gaffer Hexam, and his daughter Lizzie troll the Thames searching for drowned men whose pockets Gaffer will rifle before turning the body over to the authorities. On this particular night Gaffer finds a corpse that is later identified as that of John Harmon, who was returning from abroad to claim a large fortune when he was apparently murdered and thrown into the river. <p> Harmon's death is the catalyst for everything else that happens in the novel. It seems the fortune was left to the young man on the condition that he marry a girl he'd never met, Bella Wilfer. His death, however, brings a new heir onto the scene, Nicodemus Boffin, the kind-hearted but low-born assistant to Harmon's father. Boffin and his wife adopt young Bella, who is determined to marry money, and also hire a mysterious young secretary, John Rokesmith, who takes an uncommon interest in their ward. Not content with just one plot, Dickens throws in a secondary love story featuring the riverman's daughter, Lizzie Hexam; a dissolute young upper-class lawyer, Eugene Wrayburn; and his rival, the headmaster Bradley Headstone. Dark as the novel is, Dickens is careful to leaven it with secondary characters who are as funny as they are menacing--blackmailing Silas Wegg and his accomplice Mr. Venus, the avaricious Lammles, and self-centered Charlie Hexam. <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> is one of Dickens's most satisfying novels, and a fitting denouement to his prolific career. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>&#39;Our Mutual Friend&#39; is crammed with narratives of concealment and mistaken identity, of murder and attempted murder, of sin and redemption, and is continually propelled by a satiric impulse and a theatricality almost surreal in their power.</p><h2>Anarchist Pedagogies: Collective Actions, Theories, and Critical Reflections on Education</h2><p>Important and challenging issues in the area of anarchism and education are presented in this history of egalitarian and free-school practices. From Francisco Ferrer&#x2019;s modern schools in Spain and the Work People&#x2019;s College in the United States, to contemporary actions in developing &#x201c;free skools&#x201d; in the United Kingdom and Canada, the contributors illustrate the importance of developing complex connections between educational theories and collective actions. Major themes in the volume include learning from historical anarchist experiments in education, ways that contemporary anarchists create dynamic and situated learning spaces, and critical reflections on theoretical frameworks and educational practices. Many trailblazing thinkers and practitioners contributed to this volume, such as Jeffery Shantz, John Jordon, Abraham de Leon, Richard Kahn, Matthew Weinstein, and Alex Khasnabish. This thoughtful and provocative collection proves that egalitarian education is possible at all ages and levels.</p><p><p><strong>Robert H.

Eight years later he solved it. This book tells the story of what has come to be called the new growth theory: the paradox identified by Adam Smith more than two hundred years earlier, its disappearance and occasional resurfacing in the nineteenth century, the development of new technical tools in the twentieth century, and finally the student who could see further than his teachers.<br><br>Fascinating in its own right, new growth theory helps to explain dominant first-mover firms like IBM or Microsoft, underscores the value of intellectual property, and provides essential advice to those concerned with the expansion of the economy. Like James Gleick's <i>Chaos</i> or Brian Greene's <i>The Elegant Universe</i>, this revealing book takes us to the frontlines of scientific research; not since Robert Heilbroner's classic work <i>The Worldly Philosophers</i> have we had as attractive a glimpse of the essential science of economics.</p><p>Former <i>Boston Globe</i> columnist <b>David Warsh</b> writes the online newsletter <i>Economic Principals</i> and is presently a fellow of the American Academy in Berlin. His usual address is Somerville, Massachusetts.<i>Starred Review.</i>In this shrewd piece of intellectual history, former Boston Globe columnist Warsh shows how two contradictory concepts of Adam Smith-the invisible hand and the division of labor (famously, at a pin factory)-took on lives of their own after their 1776 publication in The Wealth of Nations, and then finally converged in the work of late 20th century economist Paul Romer. In the first half of this book, Warsh gives an entertaining and precise history of economic thought from Smith forward, through the lens of what have come to be two of his key constructs. Warsh's treatment of difficult economic concepts like value is brief but clear and accurate, and he gives equal weight to personalities, institutions and broader social forces. In the second half of the book, Warsh advances the claim that in the 1970s and 80s, when Romer divided economics into people, ideas and things, instead of labor, capital and land, he touched off a revolution in the field, one that is still playing out in now-dominant "New Growth Theory" economics. Warsh does not focus narrowly on Romer's work, but describes the social and institutional framework of modern professional economics: how ideas percolate, how papers are published, how careers advance and how meetings and societies are organized. The book brings sophisticated ideas into a complex story without losing the thread, or the reader's interest. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

They succeeded. Under the expert management of eminent classicists David Grene and Richmond Lattimore, those translations combined accuracy, poetic immediacy, and clarity of presentation to render the surviving masterpieces of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides in an English so lively and compelling that they remain the standard translations. Today, Chicago is taking pains to ensure that our Greek tragedies remain the leading English-language versions throughout the twenty-first century.</p> <p> </p> <p>In this highly anticipated third edition, Mark Griffith and Glenn W.

This edition also includes brand-new translations of Euripides&#x2019; <i>Medea</i>, <i>The Children of Heracles</i>, <i>Andromache</i>, and <i>Iphigenia among the Taurians</i>, fragments of lost plays by Aeschylus, and the surviving portion of Sophocles&#x2019;s satyr-drama <i>The Trackers</i>. New introductions for each play offer essential information about its first production, plot, and reception in antiquity and beyond. In addition, each volume includes an introduction to the life and work of its tragedian, as well as notes addressing textual uncertainties and a glossary of names and places mentioned in the plays.</p> <p> </p> <p>In addition to the new content, the volumes have been reorganized both within and between volumes to reflect the most up-to-date scholarship on the order in which the plays were originally written.

Boyden of Deerfield</h2><p><p>Starting in 1902 at a country school that had an enrollment of fourteen, Frank Boyden built an academy that has long since taken its place on a level with Andover and Exeter. Boyden, who died in 1972, was the school's headmaster for sixty-six years. John McPhee portrays a remarkable man "at the near end of a skein of magnanimous despots who...created enduring schools through their own individual energies, maintained them under their own absolute rule, and left them forever imprinted with their own personalities." More than simply a portrait of the Headmaster of Deerfield Academy, it is a revealing look at the nature of private school education in America.</p></p><p><p><b>John McPhee</b> was born in Princeton, New Jersey, and was educated at Princeton University and Cambridge University. His writing career began at <i>Time</i> magazine and led to his long association with <i>The New Yorker</i>, where he has been a staff writer since 1965. Also in 1965, he published his first book, <i>A Sense of Where You Are</i>, with Farrar, Straus and Giroux, and in the years since, he has written nearly 30 books, including <i>Oranges</i> (1967), <i>Coming into the Country</i> (1977), <i>The Control of Nature</i> (1989), <i>The Founding Fish</i> (2002), <i>Uncommon Carriers</i> (2007), and <i>Silk Parachute</i> (2011). <i>Encounters with the Archdruid</i> (1972) and <i>The Curve of Binding Energy</i> (1974) were nominated for National Book Awards in the category of science. McPhee received the Award in Literature from the Academy of Arts and Letters in 1977. In 1999, he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for <i>Annals of the Former World</i>. He lives in Princeton, New Jersey.</p>Headmaster, The <br> WHEN FRANK LEAROYD BOYDEN, who was soon to become the new headmaster of Deerfield Academy, arrived at the Deerfield station, he was only twenty-two. He walked downhill into the town for the first time, and he nodded, as he moved along, to women in full-length skirts, girls in petticoats, and little boys wearing longsleeved shirts and bowler hats. Deerfield, Massachusetts, was essentially one street--a mile from the north to the south end--under shade so deep that even in the middle of the day the braided tracery of wagon ruts became lost in shadow a hundred yards from an observer. Twenty years would pass before the street would be paved, sixyears before it would be strung overhead with electric wires. Houses that had been built two hundred years earlier were the homes of farmers. Some of them tilted a little, and shingles were flaking off their roofs. Though the town was reasonably prosperous, much of it seemed slightly out of plumb. Deerfield Academy, the community's public school, was a dispiriting red brick building that appeared to have been designed to exclude as much sunlight as possible. A century earlier, there had been more than a hundred students in the academy, but now only fourteen boys and girls were enrolled for the approaching year, two of whom would constitute the senior class. In one way, this decline was not discouraging to Boyden. He wanted to put Deerfield behind him as quickly as he could, for he wanted to go to law school and eventually to enter politics. He had been graduated from Amherst two months before. He knew that the people of Deerfield had offered the headmastership to other members of his class, but he was confident that he would get the job, because he was the only person who had applied. He had no money. Deerfield would pay eight hundred dollars a year. To save enough for law school, he intended to put away nearly every cent. He knocked at the door of a white frame house that belonged to Ephraim Williams, a trustee of the academy and the great-great-grandnephew of the founder of Williams College. "Mr. Williams," he said, "I'm Frank Boyden." The day was Tuesday, August 12, 1902. The temperature outside was in the high eighties. But Ephraim Williams, a retired cavalry officer with one leg and a walrus mustache, stood in his front parlor with his back to a blistering fire. He had a shawl over one arm and a fan in one hand. He explained that he never knew when he might suffer a chill or a fever. In this atmosphere, Boyden met other trustees as well. One of them said to him, "It's a tossup whether the academy needs a new headmaster or an undertaker." They frankly did not know whether to hire him or close the school, but if he wanted the job he could have it. In the village store, meanwhile, the town loafers had been assessing Boyden's style. In the recent past, they had seen plenty of new headmasters, and this one impressed the town about as little as the town had impressed him. He was, for one thing, five feet four inches tall. With his hair parted in the middle and with rimless spectacles, he looked forbidding but hardly forceful. Boys in that part of the state had been known to pick up schoolmasters and throw them out the window. It is still remembered that one of the men in the store that day said, "It won't be very long before they drive that young man out of here." Nothing is left of that scene--not even the store itself. Up the street, however, in the white frame house that once belonged to Ephraim Williams, lives the headmaster of Deerfield Academy. He has been the headmaster for sixty-four years. During Boyden's first forty or fifty years in this position, he so concentrated on developing the character of the school that even after Deerfield had reached the highest peerage of American independent schools its students still slept in farmhouses and watched Saturday-night movies in a barn. Some New England prep schools were established in imitation of English public schools, but Deerfield is an indigenous institution. Boyden had been there twenty years before he added its boarding department, and since then he has tried not to allow Deerfield's gradual development from a local school into a national school to detach Deerfield from the advantages of its origin. The sons of rich people and of celebrated people compete to go there, and Deerfield accepts plenty of them, but it has a higher percentage of scholarship students than, for example, Andover, Exeter, Lawrenceville, Hotchkiss, Hill, Kent, Choate, Groton, St. Mark's, St. Paul's, and, for that matter, virtually every other major preparatory school. The average Deerfield scholarship is higher than the scholarships of nearly all other schools, and local boys still go to the academy for nothing. Boyden is now in a position to select his student body from among the top ten per cent of applicants, and his only competition in this respect comes from Andover and Exeter, but at first he had difficulty drawing students even from the town of Deerfield. With a borrowed horse and buggy, he went out into the fields of the surrounding Pocumtuck Valley and talkedto young farm boys until he had persuaded them to go to school. He promised them days off at harvest, and in some cases he even paid for substitute farmhands. He continued to recruit students in this way for something over twenty years, and in successive bursts of generosity he gave up much of the personal money that he had meant to save for law school. Nonetheless, he went on reading law at night, having no intention, until he was in his late forties, of making education his permanent career. His school evolved naturally, gradually, and surprisingly. He had no plan and no theory, but he proved himself to be an educator by intuition. College professors and college presidents became aware of his work and sent their sons to him. Others did the same. By the late nineteen-thirties, it had become clear that he was one of the greatest headmasters in history, and for many years he has stood alone as, in all probability, the last man of his kind. He is at the near end of a skein of magnanimous despots who--no matter whether they had actually founded the places or not--created enduring schools through their own individual energies, maintained them under their own absolute rule, and left them forever imprinted with their own personalities. At the other end is the prototype--Thomas Arnold, of Rugby. In the United States, Frank Boyden was for years the youngest in a group that included Endicott Peabody, of Groton; Father Sill, of Kent; Horace Taft, of Taft; SamuelDrury, of St. Paul's; George C. St. John, of Choate; Alfred Stearns, of Andover; and Lewis Perry, of Exeter. The rest are gone now, and in some cases their successors are, too. Meanwhile, younger headmasters in remarkable numbers have developed under Boyden at Deerfield. At the moment, the heads of twenty-nine American prep schools are former Deerfield masters or students. Some headmasters similarly trained by Boyden have served their schools and have retired. But, in his valley in western Massachusetts, Frank Boyden, who is eighty-six, continues his work with no apparent letup, sharing his authority by the thimbleful with his faculty, travelling with his athletic teams, interviewing boys and parents who are interested in the school, conducting Sunday-night vesper services, writing as many as seventy letters a day, planning the details of new buildings, meeting with boys who are going home for the weekend and reminding them of their responsibilities to "the older travelling public," careering around his campus in an electric golf cart, and working from 7 A.M. to midnight every day. If he sees a bit of paper on the ground, he jumps out of his cart and picks it up. He is uncompromising about the appearance of his school, which has, in recent years, at last developed a physical plant that is appropriate to its reputation. The new academy buildings have been developed in consonance with the eighteenth-century houses of the town, a number of which the academy has, over the years, acquired. In all, thirty-three of the town'sold houses have been preserved. Two or three are used as dormitories. The front rooms of others have been turned into shrines of the American past and the back rooms into faculty apartments. As a municipal museum, Deerfield is of the nature and importance of Williamsburg, Virginia, with the difference that the buildings of Williamsburg are for the most part replicas and the houses of Deerfield are originals. The Deerfield street is still the same quiet mile it was in 1902. Farmers still live along it. On the site of the old, sunless schoolhouse is the main building of the academy, and around and beyond it are nineteen other buildings--classrooms, dormitories, laboratories, gymnasiums, dining hall, hockey rink, infirmary, theatre, art gallery. The academy is on a kind of peninsular plateau that was formed when the Deerfield River, which flows through the valley, shifted its course in another age. On three sides, steep banks slope to a lower level, where there are perhaps seventy-five acres of athletic fields. Hills rise to the east and west, and there are long views of farmland and tobacco barns to the north and south. It would be difficult to imagine a more beautiful setting for a school or a more attractive school in the setting. What seems incredible, though, is that all of it--both the visible substance and the invisible essence of it--was developed by one man. <i>Copyright � 1966 by John McPhee</i></p><h2>Introduction to Horticultural Science</h2><p>Designed to provide readers with a full appreciation of the wonderful world of horticultural science, the Second Edition of INTRODUCTION TO HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE covers everything the reader needs to know in a comprehensive format that is easy to understand.

I was with him at Actium, when the sword struck fire from metal, and the blood of soldiers was awash on deck and stained the blue Ionian Sea, and the javelin whistled in the air, and the burning hulls hissed upon the water, and the day was loud with the screams of men whose flesh roasted in the armor they could not fling off; and earlier I was with him at Mutina, where that same Marcus Antonius overran our camp and the sword was thrust into the empty bed where Caesar Augustus had lain, and where we persevered and earned the first power that was to give us the world; and at Philippi, where he traveled so ill he could not stand and yet made himself to be carried among his troops in a litter, and came near death again by the murderer of his father, and where he fought until the murderers of the mortal Julius, who became a god, were destroyed by their own hands. <br><br>I am Marcus Agrippa, sometimes called Vipsanius, tribune to the people and consul to the Senate, soldier and general to the Empire of Rome, and friend of Gaius Octavius Caesar, now Augustus. I write these memories in the fiftieth year of my life so that posterity may record the time when Octavius discovered Rome bleeding in the jaws of faction, when Octavius Caesar slew the factious beat and removed the almost lifeless body, and when Augustus healed the wounds of Rome and made it whole again, to walk with vigor upon the boundaries of the world. Of this triumph I have, within my abilities, been a part; and of that part these memories will be a record, so that the historians of the ages may understand their wonder at Augustus and Rome. <br><br>Under the command of Caesar Augustus I performed several functions for the restoration of Rome, for which duty Rome amply rewarded me. I was three times consul, once aedile and tribune, and twice governor of Syria; and twice I received the seal of the Sphinx from Augustus himself during his grave illnesses. Against Lucius Antonius at Perusia I led the victorious Roman legions, and against the Aquitanians at Gaul, and against the German tribes at the Rhine, for which service I refused a Triumph in Rome; and in Spain and Pannonia, too, were rebellious tribes and factions put down. By Augustus I was given title as commander in chief of our navy, and we saved our ships from the pirate Sextus Pompeius by our construction of the harbor west of the Bay of Naples, which ships later defeated and destroyed Pompeius at Mylae and Naulochus on the coast of Sicily; and for that action the Senate awarded me the naval crown. At Actium we defeated the traitor Marcus Antonius, and so restored life to the body of Rome. <br><br>In celebration of Rome's delivery from the Egyptian treason, I had erected the Temple now called the Pantheon and other public buildings. As chief administrator of the city under Augustus and the Senate, I had repaired the old aqueducts of the city and installed new ones, so that the citizens and populace of Rome might have water and be free of disease; and when peace came to Rome, I assisted in the survey and mapping of the world, begun during the dictatorship of Julius Caesar and made at last possible by his adopted son. <br><br>Of these things, I shall write more at length as these memories progress. But I must now tell of the time when these events were set into motion, the year after Julius Caesar's triumphant return from Spain, of which campaign Gaius Octavius and Salvidienus Rufus and I were members. <br><br>For I was with him at Apollonia when the news came of Caesar's death. . . . <br><br><i>II. Letter: Gaius Gilnius Maecenas to Titus Livius (13 B.C.) </i><br><br>You must forgive me, my dear Livy, for having so long delayed my reply. The usual complaints: retirement seems not to have improved the state of my health at all. The doctors shake their heads wisely, mutter mysteriously, and collect their fees. Nothing seems to help--not the vile medicines I am fed, nor even the abstinence from those pleasures which (as you know) I once enjoyed. The gout has made it impossible for me to hold my pen in hand these last few days, though I know how diligently you pursue your work and what need you have of my assistance in the matter of which you have written me. And along with my other infirmities, I have for the past few weeks been afflicted by an insomnia, so that my days are spent in weariness and lassitude. But my friends do not desert me, and life stays; for those two things I must be grateful. <br><br>You ask me about the early days of my association with our Emperor. You ought to know that only three days ago he was good enough to visit my house, inquiring after my illnesses, and I felt it politic to inform him of your request. He smiled and asked me whether or not I felt it proper to aid such an unregenerate Republican as yourself; and then we fell to talking about the old days, as men who feel the encroachment of age will do. He remembers things--little things--even more vividly than I, whose profession it has been to forget nothing. At last I asked him if he would prefer to have sent to you his own account of that time. He looked away into the distance for a moment and smiled again and said, "No--Emperors may let their memories lie even more readily than poets and historians." He asked me to send you his warm regards, and gave me permission to write to you with whatever freedom I could find. <br><br>But what freedom can I find to speak to you of those days? We were young; and though Gaius Octavius, as he was called then, knew that he was favored by his destiny and that Julius Caesar intended his adoption, neither he nor I nor Marcus Agrippa nor Salvidienus Rufus, who were his friends, could truly imagine where we would be led. I do not have the freedom of the historian, my friend; you may recount the movements of men and armies, trace the intricate course of state intrigues, balance victories and defeats, relate births and deaths--and yet still be free, in the wise simplicity of your task, from the awful weight of a kind of knowledge that I cannot name but that I more and more nearly apprehend as the years draw on. I know what you want; and you are no doubt impatient with me because I do not get on with it and give you the facts that you need. But you must remember that despite my services to the state, I am a poet, and incapable of approaching anything very directly. <br><br>It may surprise you to learn that I had not known Octavius until I met him at Brindisi, where I had been sent to join him and his group of friends on the way to Apollonia. The reasons for my being there remain obscure to me; it was through the intercession of Julius Caesar, I am sure. My father, Lucius, had once done Julius some service; and a few years before, he had visited us at our villa in Arezzo. I argued with him about something (I was, I believe, asserting the superiority of Callimachus's poems to Catullus's), and I became arrogant, abusive, and (I thought) witty. I was very young. At any rate, he seemed amused by me, and we talked for some time. Two years later, he ordered my father to send me to Apollonia in the company of his nephew. <br><br>My friend, I must confess to you (though you may not use it) that I was in no profound way impressed with Octavius upon that occasion of our first meeting. I had just come down to Brindisi from Arezzo and after more than ten days of traveling, I was weary to the bone, filthy with the dust of the road, and irritable. I came upon them at the pier from which we were to embark. Agrippa and Salvidienus were talking together, and Octavius stood somewhat apart from them, gazing at a small ship that was anchored nearby. They had given no sign of noticing my approach. I said, somewhat too loudly, I imagine: "I am the Maecenas who was to meet you here. Which of you is which?" <br><br>Agrippa and Salvidienus looked at me amusedly and gave me their names; Octavius did not turn; and thinking that I saw arrogance and disdain in his back, I said: "And you must be the other, whom they call Octavius." <br><br>Then he turned, and I knew that I was foolish; for there was an almost desperate shyness on his face. He said: "Yes, I am Gaius Octavius. My uncle has spoken of you." Then he smiled and offered me his hand and raised his eyes and looked at me for the first time. <br><br>As you know, much has been said about those eyes, more often than not in bad meter and worse prose; I think by now he must be sick of hearing the metaphors and whatnot describing them, though he may have been vain about them at one time. But they were, even then, extraordinarily clear and piercing and sharp--more blue than gray, perhaps, though one thought of light, not color. . . . There, you see? I have started doing it myself; I have been reading too many of my friends' poems. <br><br>I may have stepped back a pace; I do not know. At any rate, I was startled, and so I looked away, and my eyes fell upon the ship at which Octavius had been gazing. <br><br>"Is that the scow that's going to take us across?" I asked. I was feeling a little more cheerful. It was a small merchant ship, not more than fifty feet in length, with rotting timbers at the prow and patched sails. A stench rose from it. <br><br>Agrippa spoke to me. "We are told that it is the only one available." He was smiling at me a little; I imagine that he thought me fastidious, for I was wearing my toga and had on several rings, while they wore only tunics and carried no ornaments. <br><br>"The stench will be unendurable," I said. <br><br>Octavius said gravely, "I believe it is going to Apollonia for a load of pickled fish." <br><br>I was silent for a moment; and then I laughed, and we all laughed, and we were friends. <br><br>Perhaps we are wiser when we are young, though the philosopher would dispute with me. But I swear to you, we were friends from that moment onward; and that moment of foolish laughter was a bond stronger than anything that came between us later--victories or defeats, loyalties or betrayals, griefs or joys. But the days of youth go, and part of us goes with them, not to return. <br><br>Thus it was that we crossed to Apollonia, in a stinking fish boat that groaned with the gentlest wave, that listed so perilously to its side that we had to brace ourselves so that we would not tumble across the deck, and that carried us to a destiny we could not then imagine. . . . <br><br>I resume the writing of this letter after an interruption of two days; I shall not trouble you with a detailing of the maladies that occasioned that interruption; it is all too depressing. <br><br>In any event, I have seen that I do not give you the kind of thing that will be of much use to you, so I have had my secretary go through some of my papers in search of matters more helpful to your task. You may remember that some ten years ago I spoke at the dedication of our friend Marcus Agrippa's Temple of Venus and Mars, now popularly called the Pantheon. In the beginning I had the idea, later discarded, of doing a rather fanciful oration, almost a poem, if I may say so, which made some odd connections between the state of Rome as we had found it as young men and the state of Rome as this temple now represents it. At any rate, as an aid to my own solution to the problem that the form of this projected oration raised, I made some notes about those early days, which I now draw upon in an effort to aid you in the completion of your history of our world. <br><br>Picture, if you can, four youths (they are strangers to me now), ignorant of their future and of themselves, ignorant indeed of that very world in which they are beginning to live. One (that is Marcus Agrippa) is tall and heavy-muscled, with the face almost of a peasant--strong nose, big bones, and a skin like new leather; dry, brownish hair, and a coarse red stubble of beard; he is nineteen. He walks heavily, like a bullock, but there is an odd grace about him. He speaks plainly, slowly, and calmly, and does not show what he feels. Except for his beard, one would not know that he is so young. <br><br>Another (this is Salvidienus Rufus) is as thin and agile as Agrippa is heavy and stalwart, as quick and volatile as Agrippa is slow and reserved. His face is lean, his skin fair, his eyes dark; he laughs readily, and lightens the gravity which the rest of us affect. He is older than any of us, but we love him as if he were our younger brother. <br><br>And a third (is it myself?) whom I see even more dimly than the others. No man may know himself, nor how he must appear even to his friends; but I imagine they must have thought me a bit of a fool, that day, and even for some time afterward. I was a bit luxuriant then, and fancied that a poet must play the part. I dressed richly, my manner was affected, and I had brought along with me from Arezzo a servant whose sole duty it was to care for my hair--until my friends derided me so mercilessly that I had him returned to Italy. <br><br>And at last he who was then Gaius Octavius. How may I tell you of him? I do not know the truth; only my memories. I can say again that he seemed to me a boy, though I was a scant two years older. You know his appearance now; it has not changed much. But now he is Emperor of the world, and I must look beyond that to see him as he was then; and I swear to you that I, whose service to him has been my knowledge of the hearts of both his friends and enemies, could not have foreseen what he was to become. I thought him a pleasant stripling, no more, with a face too delicate to receive the blows of fate, with a manner too diffident to achieve purpose, and with a voice too gentle to utter the ruthless words that a leader of men must utter. I thought that he might become a scholar of leisure, or a man of letters; I did not think that he had the energy to become even a senator, to which his named and wealth entitled him.</p><h2>The Orange Eats Creeps</h2><p><p><strong>*National Book Foundation '5 Under 35' Award</strong><br><strong>*NPR Best Books of 2010</strong><br><strong>*<em>The Believer</em> Book Award Finalist</strong><br><strong>*Indie Bookseller's Choice Awards Finalist</strong></p><p><strong>"The book feels written in a fever; it is breathless, scary, and like nothing I've ever read before.

It focuses on the educational, legal, and social construction of race and racism, and on educational practices related to deculturalization, segregation, and the civil rights movement. Spring emphasizes issues of power and control in schools and shows how the dominant Anglo class has stripped away the culture of minority peoples in the U.S. and replaced it with the dominant culture. In the process, he gives voice to the often-overlooked perspectives of African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, and Native Americans. An understanding of these historical perspectives and how they impact current conditions and policies is critical to teachers&#x2019; success or failure in today&#x2019;s diverse classrooms. <p> Very brief and affordable, <i>Deculturalization and the Struggle for Equality </i>is an ideal supplement for Introduction/Foundations of Education, Multicultural Education, or any course that seeks to expand student notions of what U.S. education has been and can be.</p></p><p>Joel Spring received his Ph.D. in educational policy studies from the University of Wisconsin.

Now in paperback, Kathleen Cushman&#x2019;s groundbreaking book offers original insights into teaching teenagers in today&#x2019;s hard-pressed urban high schools from the point of view of the students themselves. It speaks to both new and established teachers, giving them firsthand information about who their students are and what they need to succeed.<br> <br>Students from across the country contributed perceptive and pragmatic answers to questions of how teachers can transcend the barriers of adolescent identity and culture to reach the diverse student body in today&#x2019;s urban schools. With the fresh and often surprising perspectives of youth, they tackle tough issues such as increasing engagement and motivation, teaching difficult academic material, reaching English-language learners, and creating a classroom culture where respect and success go hand in hand.</p><p><b>Kathleen Cushman</b> is the author of <i>Fires in the Middle School Bathroom</i>(The New Press). As a writer for What Kids Can Do, Inc., a national nonprofit organization, she works to bring forward the voices of student writers around the nation.She lives in New York City.<b>Preface</b> <br> <br> AND THEN THEY SET FIRES IN THE BATHROOM, WHILE SHE WAS TRYING TO BE SO FRIENDLY."<br> <br>It&#x2019;s a safe bet that in random high schools all over the United States, some<br>kid has just set the bathroom wastebasket on fire. And deep down, all of us<br>know why.<br> <br>Anyone who has made it out of their teens most likely remembers the feelings<br>of anonymity and captivity that even the best high schools can convey.<br>Whether in huge urban warehouses, sprawling suburban campuses, or newly<br>consolidated rural schools, teachers with more than 125 students a day can&#x2019;t<br>help but focus the majority of their attention on only the most urgent cases.<br>In such settings, order trumps most other institutional aims. To keep the<br>place running smoothly, students&#x2019; behavior becomes more important than their<br>understanding, acquiescence more valued than inquiry. In pursuit of order,<br>school and classroom rules routinely supplant the disarray of kids&#x2019; questions,<br>objections, suggestions, and problems. High school becomes something done to<br>kids, not by kids. This is the way it works; this is the way it has always worked.<br> <br>Against this backdrop, the voices of the students who helped write this book<br>took on even more importance to What Kids Can Do, Inc. (WKCD), the new<br>nonprofit organization that asked me to gather teenagers&#x2019; advice for an audience<br>of teachers and the public. Based in Providence, Rhode Island, WKCD<br>researches and makes public the work and learning of adolescents around the<br>United States via its website and also through networks of others who care<br>about or work with youth. For this book project, WKCD won support from<br>MetLife Foundation, whose Supporting New Teachers Initiative recognizes how<br>much new teachers could learn from students if only given the chance.<br> <br>With two million new teachers needed over the next decade and 60 percent<br>of beginning teachers quitting the profession within their first five years,<br>advice from the classroom could not be more important. Research shows that<br>too many schools across the country suffer from a persistent divide, one pitting<br>teachers and students against each other. In a 2001 national survey, 65 percent<br>of students agreed with the statement, My teachers don&#x2019;t understand me,&#x201d; and<br>33 percent of the teachers reported inadequate preparation to reach students<br>with backgrounds different from their own.<br> <br>In this climate, I set out to collect what would become sheaves of interviews<br>and writing from forty students in New York City, Providence, and the San<br>Francisco Bay Area. Through school connections made during years of education<br>writing, I found ordinary students who reflected the faces and backgrounds<br>of their diverse student populations. Some had moved from typical big-city<br>schools into small schools; others had dropped out altogether before returning<br>to class. Several performed well academically, but many struggled. Twenty were<br>recent immigrants, English-language learners in a special class at a large California<br>high school. Another half dozen spoke no English at home but took regular classes<br>at school. Whenever I found students who agreed to participate, I asked whether<br>they could interest a friend in coming, too.<br> <br>Except for the class of English-language learners, we met in small groups of<br>three to five students, usually on weekends and during school vacations. Each<br>group worked for at least three sessions of three to five hours, and we paid<br>students for their time at an hourly rate comparable to that of undergraduate<br> research assistants.<br> <br>From their short biographies (pages 197 to 199) and their words throughout<br>this book, a vivid mosaic emerges of the individual narratives these students<br>brought to our discussions, debate, and analysis. As diverse a group in ethnicity and<br> academic record as their schoolmates in the cities where they live, these young<br> messengers realize well that most of their teachers do not share their background.<br>Their advice also recognizes the differences among themselves: Every high school<br> student is unique, making the teacher&#x2019;s job even harder.<br> <br>Yet strikingly, their daily encounters with teachers ring true across the<br>board not just for students of color and language minorities like themselves,<br>but equally for their more privileged peers. As they trade wisdom on how to<br>navigate high school, they invariably strike the same chords kids everywhere<br>sound when they let down their guard to recount their school experiences.<br> <br> Socially, kids hate you if you succeed too much,&#x201d; observes Mika, whose<br>strict Jamaican parents demand the highest achievement from her. It&#x2019;s like:<br> Shut up! Why do you have to rub it in my face that you know and I don&#x2019;t!&#x2019; I didn&#x2019;<br>t learn that until it was too late, and then I completely shut up in class.&#x201d; Alexis, who<br> has shuttled through three New York City high schools, elaborates: Intimidation is<br> the key. Teenagers care about what other people think of them, and so they feel<br> intimidated.&#x201d;<br> <br>They speak of their need to be known well but to maintain boundaries and<br>privacy. They crave respect from adults, feeling retaliatory rage when humiliated or<br>ignored. Kids want to learn,&#x201d; in one Harlem student&#x2019;s words, and they hunger for<br>the power to shape their own futures. They know their lives are in flux, and when<br>things go wrong, they want someone to help without shaming them. As Alexis points<br>out, Teachers need to make allowance for the fact that we change from year to year<br> and even from week to week.&#x201d;<br> <br>Throughout their work on this book, students showed enormous appreciation<br>for the teachers who helped them learn. Though they offer plenty of criticism<br>and advice, they testify time after time to a teacher&#x2019;s power to change their minds<br> and their lives. They respond with real attachment and respect when a teacher believes<br> in them, offering support through difficulties. Maribel&#x2019;s favorite teacher at her large<br>Providence high school is always willing to talk and can get you interested by asking<br>questions.&#x201d; Alexis describes her math teacher: He won&#x2019;t let you give up.&#x201d; And they<br>observe that sometimes a good teacher helps them learn just by treating them with<br>warmth and understanding. She would find times outside of the classroom to ask me<br> how I was doing, and to let me know that I could go to her if I needed anything at all,&#x201d;<br>says Tiffany about a teacher who recognized the difficulty of being a black student in a<br>largely white school. Veronica, a fifteen-year-old from Oakland, says of her biology<br>teacher: He has changed our lives forever.&#x201d;<br> <br>As originally conceived, this book would have devoted a chapter to each of<br>the key academic areas, offering students&#x2019; insights on how to teach them most<br>effectively. But as the torrent of student voices mounted with each work session, we<br>realized the mistake of that assumption. Our groups offered surprisingly little critique of<br>curriculum and assessment. They focused more on the relationships that made learning<br>possible.<br> <br>Might listening carefully to these students change high schools enough so<br>kids would no longer set fires in the bathroom? We know instinctively that<br>teachers, as with physicians and attorneys, perform best when they not only<br>know their material well but notice and respond sensitively to the people they<br>serve. But faced with the ever-shifting needs and opinions of adolescents, a<br>teacher might easily despair of ever hitting the delicate balance these student<br>co-authors say they want: adult authority and guidance mixed with a healthy<br>measure of flexibility.<br> <br>Without genuine dialogue, such an aim remains elusive. In organizing students&#x2019;<br>words into the following chapters, I tried to focus their diverse perspectives, with the<br>goal of fostering better communication. In the narrative voice,<br> we&#x201d; indicates student consensus on their advice, and I revert to the third person when<br> summarizing or interpreting their responses. Kids&#x2019; observations, at<br>times blunt and irreverent, appear here unedited, with an occasional translation<br>for those of us not cool enough to understand. For the sake of authenticity, I<br>chose not to exclude suggestions that seasoned teachers would agree are<br>impractical.<br> <br>Above all, this book aims to foster a teacher&#x2019;s habit of paying close attention<br>to what students say, whether they speak through words or actions. As Lauraliz,<br>a quiet and careful seventeen-year-old from the Bronx, reminds us: I been looking<br> for a teacher I can talk to, and I think I found that teacher. I don&#x2019;t really know how to<br> approach him yet, but when I need to talk about something, I&#x2019;ll find a way.&#x201d;<br> <br>One day, after a long and animated work session, I asked the students around our<br> table, Has anyone ever asked you questions like these before?&#x201d; They paused to think,<br>then every head shook no.<br> <br>This book, I hope, will help to right that silence.<br> <br> <i>Kathleen Cushman</i> <br>Harvard, Massachusetts<br>September 2002<br></p><h2>Little Sins Mean a Lot: Kicking Our Bad Habits Before They Kick Us</h2><p>Most of us at one time have said, or thought, something like:<p></p><ul><li> So I procrastinate, it s not like it s hurting anyone! </li><li> Enough about you, back to me. </li><li> I deserve this, so I m treating myself! </li><li> If I can t have it, she shouldn t either. </li><li> I ll get around to it... or not. </li><li> It s not really gossip if it s all true, right? </li><li>(And the granddaddy of them all) But that doesn t make me a bad person! </li></ul><p></p><p>Are these really sins, you ask?

We long to identify it, quantify it, and understand it. To this end, newspapers frequently splash photographs of murderers with the caption "The face of evil." Heading most lists of the 20th century's most evil people would be Adolf Hitler, but, as Michael Burleigh's tour de force makes clear, evil is not always as cut-and-dried as we would like. The Nazis could not have come to power and committed Germany to a policy of war and genocide without the tacit consent of the German people. This makes Germany as a whole responsible for the crimes committed in its name, but it is clearly wrong to label every German as evil. Through his painstaking research and direct prose, Burleigh slowly builds up a picture of a people desperate for identity and economic prosperity, who, bit by bit, closed off their conscience as the price of their dreams. There was no one cathartic moment when Germany, under the Third Reich, lapsed from goodness into badness; rather, there was an incremental realignment of a collective morality. Burleigh's explanation of this phenomenon is so simple, yet so obviously right, that you can only wonder that it didn't become the generally accepted currency years ago.<p> Instead of viewing Nazi Germany in purely social, political, and economic terms--though he doesn't ignore these spheres--Burleigh wraps them all into a picture of a country gripped in a religious, messianic fervor, and that which had previously felt inexplicable suddenly seems clear. If you want the nitty-gritty details of the Second World War and the genocide, they are here, retold as well as, if not better than, many of the other histories of this period. But it's Burleigh's take on the people of Germany that makes this book so special. Above all, with similar genocidal wars currently being fought in Kosovo, Rwanda, and Iraq, it makes you think, "Would I be able to resist becoming complicit in such regimes?" This is a must for every 20th-century historian. <i>--John Crace, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><b>MICHAEL BURLEIGH</b>, William R.

Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.Typee (1846) is the first &#39;romance&#39; of the semi-autobiographical account of life in the Marquesas Islands in the 1840s. A blend of personal experience and the narratives of explorers and missionaries, it influenced many later writers on the Paciflc, including Robert Louis Stevenson and Jack London. Melville himself deserted from a whaling ship in the islands and lived for four weeks among the inhabitants, observing and recording their way of life. Typee points up the wonders, the dilemmas, the &#39;fatal impact&#39; of European encounter with the peoples of the Pacific.

The lengthy process of de-skunking the church requires its annual pre-Christmas concert to relocate to Trinity Episcopal, where Mother insists the show must go on, despite the budget-related protests of Mr. Vess, an elderly vestryman. Meanwhile, when Meg helps her grandfather take the skunks to the zoo, they discover that his boa has been stolen. . .only to turn up later during the concert, slithering out from the ribbon-bedecked evergreens.

We were opening presents and all the boxes I&#x2019;d wrapped so neatly had suddenly become empty. Or worse, they contained odd, inappropriate objects, like bottles of vodka for my four-year-old twin sons and a subscription to <i>Guns &amp; Ammo</i> for my cousin Rose Noire, who couldn&#x2019;t even stand to see anyone use a flyswatter for its intended purpose. <br>&#x201c;What interesting choices,&#x201d; Mother was murmuring, holding up the power drill that had been in her box. Where had the drill come from? And why did she keep turning it on and off, on and off, making that irritating noise? <br>Just then I woke up. I fumbled on my bedside table for my phone. It was a little past 4:00 A.M. December twenty-first, not the twenty-fifth. <br>&#x201c;Only a dream,&#x201d; I murmured. <br>The buzzing wasn&#x2019;t coming from my phone and I could still hear it. Not a power drill. It appeared to be coming from Michael&#x2019;s side of the bed, from under the pillow. Some battery-operated toy, perhaps, that the boys had dropped while Michael had been reading them <i>How the Grinch Stole Christmas</i> before bedtime? <br>Michael stirred. <br>&#x201c;Blast.&#x201d; His voice was sleepy and annoyed. Then he sat bolt upright and began searching frantically under his pillow. <br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; I asked. <br>&#x201c;My pager.&#x201d; He found the offending object, pressed something, and the buzzing stopped. A female voice took its place. <br>&#x201c;Box fourteen oh four for the structure fire. One thirteen Clay County Road. Engine companies fourteen and two, truck twelve, rescue squad two, ambulance fourteen respond. Oh four fourteen.&#x201d; <br>I recognized the voice of Debbie Ann, the local police and emergency dispatcher. And the &#x201c;oh four fourteen&#x201d; part must be the time. As for the rest&#x2014; <br>&#x201c;We have a call!&#x201d; Michael sounded excited and leaped out of bed. <br>My stomach clenched. Ever since Michael, in a burst of civic zeal, had joined the Caerphilly Volunteer Firefighters, I&#x2019;d been dreading this moment. The pager had been his constant companion since he&#x2019;d finished his training a week ago. And now here it was: His first fire. <br>The address sounded familiar, too. I had the feeling if I were a little more awake, I&#x2019;d remember exactly what was located at 113 Clay County Road. <br>Michael dove into the walk-in closet. <br>&#x201c;Maybe you should wake Rob,&#x201d; he called over his shoulder. <br>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t he have a pager, too?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You know Rob.&#x201d; <br>Yes. My brother&#x2014;also a newly fledged firefighter&#x2014;was capable of sleeping with a brass band rehearsing at the foot of his bed. I got up and winced when my feet hit the cold floor. It was in the twenties outside, and didn&#x2019;t seem much warmer inside. Not a night for running around barefoot or in pajamas. I threw on my clothes, then raced out into the hall, and headed up the stairs to the third floor of our overlarge Victorian farmhouse, where my brother lived in one of our many spare rooms. <br>On my way upstairs I passed my cousin Rose Noire who occupied yet another third-floor spare room. <br>&#x201c;Rob&#x2019;s awake,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;His pager woke me from across the hall, so I woke him. I&#x2019;ll make them some coffee.&#x201d; <br>I could hear thuds and exclamations from down the hall. Rob was in motion. Had the noise awakened my twin sons? They&#x2019;d only recently moved to separate bedrooms. Although it had been their own request and they were vastly proud of their new solo lairs, they were both still a little anxious when awakened in the middle of the night and prone to creeping into our room or each other&#x2019;s. <br>I went back down and peeked into Josh&#x2019;s room first. A few less beloved stuffed animals were scattered across the royal blue sheets and blankets on his bed. Both boys were fast asleep in Jamie&#x2019;s room, curled up together beneath the bright red bedding. I pulled the door closed to make sure they didn&#x2019;t wake when Rob came thundering down the stairs in full gear, including the world&#x2019;s noisiest boots. He&#x2019;d probably have tried sliding down the banister for greater speed if the polished oak hadn&#x2019;t been completely swathed in evergreen and tinsel. Then when the noise died down, I slipped out again. Rob was standing in the hallway outside Michael&#x2019;s and my bedroom door. <br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Michael?&#x201d; he stage-whispered. <br>&#x201c;Here.&#x201d; Michael stepped out of our room, still fastening bits of gear. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll drive.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; Rob said. &#x201c;Meet you out front.&#x201d; <br>I pitched in to help Michael with his gear. Rob clattered the rest of the way down to the front hall, where Rose Noire was standing beside the Christmas tree, holding two travel coffee mugs. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s only instant,&#x201d; she said as she handed one to Rob. &#x201c;So I added just a hint of nutmeg.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s caffeinated, right?&#x201d; he asked as he grabbed the mug and opened the door. <br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; Rose Noire looked mildly affronted that he&#x2019;d doubted her, but given her fondness for trying to reform everyone else&#x2019;s caffeine habits with odd-tasting herbal concoctions, I could understand why he&#x2019;d asked. <br>Rob ran out. I finished fastening the last buckle holding bits of gear to Michael&#x2019;s belt. <br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; he said, giving me a kiss. &#x201c;And yes, I&#x2019;ll be careful.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the fire?&#x201d; Rose Noire asked. <br>&#x201c;At one thirteen Clay County Road,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Whatever that is.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The New Life Baptist Church.&#x201d; Michael frowned. &#x201c;At least I think. It would help if they just came out and said it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sounds right to me,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Somewhere in town&#x2014;you can have Rob look it up on his cell phone well before you need to make any turns.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Good idea.&#x201d; Michael took the second travel mug, murmured his thanks, and followed Rob. <br>Rose Noire and I looked at each other. We knew many of the New Life congregation&#x2014;particularly Henry Burke, our local police chief, and his wife, Minerva. And I&#x2019;d been over at the church last night when a friend who had to work the night shift asked me to take her daughter to choir rehearsal. <br>We heard Michael&#x2019;s car start up and race off. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s four twenty&#x2014;a.m.,&#x201d; Rose Noire added, as if she thought I might not have noticed the darkness. &#x201c;I doubt if there would be anyone there now.&#x201d; <br>If she was trying to make me feel better, it wasn&#x2019;t working. <br>&#x201c;Which could mean the fire would have plenty of time to become big and dangerous before anyone reported it,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Watch the boys, will you? I&#x2019;m heading over there.&#x201d; <br>I grabbed my coat from the enormous Victorian hat rack and my purse and keys from the hall table and dashed out into the bitter cold night. <br>Then I dashed in again, and upstairs to add another layer of clothes. <br>Even though I prided myself on how quickly I could get dressed and ready in the morning, I was at least five minutes behind Michael and Rob when I set out. Maybe ten. <br>A good thing this hadn&#x2019;t happened two nights ago, when we&#x2019;d had near-blizzard conditions. Or last night, when the plows still hadn&#x2019;t finished moving the foot of snow off our roads. All we had tonight was the bitter cold, which meant the huge mounds of snow lining the roads weren&#x2019;t going away any time soon. <br>I was relieved when I drew near the New Life Church and could still see its enormous steeple rising proudly into the air, illuminated by floodlights below&#x2014;and with no flames or smoke. <br>By the time I pulled into the parking lot, I was not just relieved but downright puzzled. The church looked unharmed. All three of Caerphilly County&#x2019;s fire vehicles were there, along with four police cruisers. All their lights were flashing. The firefighters and deputies were all standing around in clumps, staring at the church, except for one larger group that seemed to be staring at something at the back of the ambulance. <br>I scanned the scene. No, the church was fine. Not just the church but the entire sprawling complex, including two wings and a small outbuilding, all filled with classrooms, meeting rooms, and the multiple rehearsal rooms for New Life&#x2019;s nationally renowned gospel choir. The floodlit fa�ade was serene and unmarred by any signs of a conflagration. <br>I pulled into a parking space toward the side of the lot, about twenty feet from the ambulance, and close to where Michael and the other firefighters had parked. I was aiming to be far enough away that I wouldn&#x2019;t be underfoot, but close enough that I might overhear what was going on. And my chosen spot was partly behind one of the mountains of snow that the snowplows had piled up, so maybe the firefighters wouldn&#x2019;t notice me quite as easily. <br>As I turned the engine off, I saw a particularly tall fireman detach himself from the group around the ambulance and stride over toward my car. So much for my attempt to stay unnoticed. I braced myself to defend my right to rubberneck, and then relaxed. It was Michael. I opened the door and stepped out. <br>&#x201c;The good news is there&#x2019;s no fire,&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the bad&#x2014; Oh, gross!&#x201d; <br>The wind had shifted, bringing with it an unmistakable odor, like garlic, rotten eggs, and burned rubber all mixed together. <br>&#x201c;Is that what I think it is?&#x201d; I asked. <br>&#x201c;Yes. The church has been skunked.&#x201d; <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Donna Andrews</p><h2>Like a Lampshade in a Whorehouse</h2><p>From housewife to humorist, the late-great Phyllis Diller has been making millions laugh for five decades with her groundbreaking comedy. Now the laughter continues with her uproarious autobiography.<br><br> <i>Like a Lampshade in a Whorehouse</i> recounts how, against all odds, Phyllis Diller became America&#x2019;s first successful and best-loved female stand-up comic. She began her professional career at age thirty-seven, in spite of the fact that she was a housewife and mother of five, and was working at a radio station because of her husband&#x2019;s chronic unemployment. Now, fifty years later, after two traumatic marriages, extensive cosmetic surgery, numerous film, television, and stage appearances, and separate careers as an artist and piano soloist with symphony orchestras, Phyllis Diller finally tells her story.<br><br> With her trademark laugh, self-deprecating humor, and incredible wit, Phyllis Diller has etched her way into comedic history. And while her wild hair and outrageous clothes may make her look like a lampshade in a whorehouse, her strength, self-belief, perseverance, and raucous sense of humor make her truly unforgettable.</p><p>Phyllis Diller, the world's first and foremost successful female stand-up comic, has been at the top of her game for five decades. <br><br> Richard Buskin has written more than a dozen books, including biographies of Princess Diana, Marilyn Monroe, and Sheryl Crow. He makes his home in Chicago.Brash comedy and a surprising bitterness fuel this unsparing account of Diller's drive to make it big. Born to elderly parents in Lima, Ohio, in 1917, Phyllis Ada Driver was blessed with neither beauty nor wealth. At 20--and already pregnant--she married Sherwood Diller, a handsome, selfish ne'er-do-well who became the "Fang" in her comic monologues of domestic life; the couple had five children. Nearly 40 when she began her performing career, Diller turned a knack for relentless self-deprecation into a nightclub act. She performed in <i>The Poets' Follies of 1955</i> with poet/painter/composer Weldon Kees and Beat writer Lawrence Ferlinghetti. But women were a novelty in the bar-based world of stand-up comedy, and plenty of humiliating club engagements ensued. Diller persisted, though, and while her male colleagues (Milton Berle, Don Rickles, Lenny Bruce) were pioneering 1950s "insult comedy," she turned the venom on herself and reaped its rewards. Eventually shedding her dud husband, Diller became a superstar--and the first one to go public about her plastic surgery ("I was a walking billboard for plastic surgery," she observes wryly). Retired from show business since 2002, Diller retains a dedicated fan base and an enormous interest in the world that spawned her. And considering she's the original "He's just not into me" girl, a pioneering desperate housewife, might this be the time to launch a comeback? <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In this book, based on a series of his lectures, the eminent Jungian analyst and writer Edward F. Edinger revisits all the major figures, myths, oracles, and legends of the ancient Greek religion to discover what they can still reveal�&#x20ac;&#x201d;representing, as they do, one of the religious and mythic foundations of Western culture. Building on C. G. Jung's assertion that mythology is an expression of the deepest layers of mind and soul, Dr. Edinger follows the mythic images into their persistent manifestations in literature and on into our modern lives. He finds that the gods indeed continue to speak as we grow in our capacity to listen and that the myths express the inner energies within all of us as much as ever. Heracles is eternally performing his labors, Perseus is still confronting Medusa, Theseus is forever stalking the Minotaur, and Persephone is still being carried off to life in a new realm.</p><p>Edinger, a Jungian psychologist, examines the major figures in Greek mythology and analyzes the gods, goddesses, and heroes of these myths to find archetypes described by Jung. Basing his book on a series of lectures he gave in the 1970s, Edinger traces Jungian archetypes through poetry, literature, and the dreams of patients and shows how others have built on the myths. Unfortunately, when he describes the personality types of the mythical figures and explains how people today manifest an Apollo personality or are psychologically akin to Ares, the author makes connections and generalizations that are sometimes hard for the reader to accept. Still, this book would be helpful to students of Jungian psychology who want a perspective on the ties between Jung and the Greek myths.

He was sure he&#x2019;d heard someone talking in his bedroom. And since he was alone in the house, he became alarmed.</p><p>Then he started laughing, having remembered that Livia had shown up unannounced at his place that evening. The surprise visit had pleased him immensely, at least at first. And there she was now, sleeping soundly beside him.</p><p>A still-violet shaft of the dawn&#x2019;s very earliest light shone through the window shutter. He let his eyelids droop without bothering to look at the clock, in hopes of getting a few more hours of sleep.</p><p>But then his eyes suddenly popped open again. Something had just occurred to him.</p><p>If someone had spoken in his bedroom, it could only have been Livia. She&#x2019;d therefore been talking in her sleep. But this had never happened before. Or perhaps it wasn&#x2019;t the first time. But if she had in fact talked in her sleep before, she&#x2019;d done it so quietly that it hadn&#x2019;t woken him up.</p><p>And it was possible she was, at that moment, still in the same dream state and might say a few more words.</p><p>So this was an opportunity not to be missed.</p><p>People who suddenly start talking in their sleep can&#x2019;t help but say true things, the truths that they have inside them. He remembered reading that it was impossible to tell lies or stretch the truth in a dream state, because one is defenseless when asleep, as helpless and innocent as a baby.</p><p>It was very important not to miss anything of what Livia was saying. Important for two reasons. The first was general in nature, being that a man can live a hundred years at a woman&#x2019;s side, sleep with her, have children with her, breathe the same air as her, and think he knows her as well as humanly possible, and still, in the end, feel as though he never really knows what she is like deep inside.</p><p>The other reason was more specific and immediate in nature.</p><p>He carefully got out of bed and went and looked outside through the slats of the shutter. It promised to be a lovely day, without clouds or wind.</p><p>Then he went over to Livia&#x2019;s side of the bed, pulled up a chair, and sat down at the head, as in an all-night vigil at the hospital.</p><p>The previous evening&#x2014;and this was the more specific reason&#x2014;Livia had raised a big stink in a fit of jealousy, ruining the pleasure he had felt by her surprise visit.</p><p>Things had gone as follows.</p><p>The telephone had rung and she went to answer.</p><p>But as soon as she said hello, a woman&#x2019;s voice at the other end had said:</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m sorry, I must have the wrong number.&#x201d;</p><p>And she promptly hung up.</p><p>And so Livia got it in her head that the caller had been a woman he was having an affair with, that they&#x2019;d arranged to meet that evening, and that when she&#x2019;d heard Livia&#x2019;s voice she&#x2019;d hung up.</p><p>&#x201c;I guess I rained on your parade, eh? . . . When the cat&#x2019;s away, the mice will play! . . . Out of sight, out of mind! . . .&#x201d;</p><p>There was no making her see reason, and things ended terribly that evening because Montalbano had reacted badly, disgusted not so much by Livia&#x2019;s suspicions as by the endless barrage of clich�s she kept firing at him.</p><p>So Montalbano was now hoping that Livia would say something stupid in her sleep, anything that might give him ammunition for a proper revenge.</p><p>He suddenly had a great desire to smoke a cigarette but restrained himself&#x2014;first, because if Livia woke up and found him smoking in the bedroom, a revolution might break out, and second, because the smoke itself might wake her up.</p><p>About two hours later, he got a cramp in his left calf.</p><p>To make it go away, he started swinging his leg back and forth and, as a result, ended up dealing the wooden bed frame a violent kick with his bare foot.</p><p>It hurt like hell, but he managed to hold back the avalanche of curses that threatened to burst out of him.</p><p>The kick had an effect, however, because Livia sighed, moved a little, and then spoke.</p><p>Giving first a little laugh, in a full voice with no trace of hoarseness, she said distinctly:</p><p>&#x201c;No, Carlo, not from behind.&#x201d;</p><p>Montalbano nearly fell out of his chair. This was a bit too much of a good thing, for Chrissakes!</p><p>A couple of muttered words would have sufficed, just enough for him to build a castle of baseless accusations, Jesuit-like.</p><p>But Livia had uttered a whole sentence, loud and clear! Fuck!</p><p>As if she had been completely awake.</p><p>And it was a sentence that suggested just about everything, even the worst.</p><p>Meanwhile, she had never said a word to him about any Carlo. Why not?</p><p>If she&#x2019;d never mentioned him, there must be a reason.</p><p>And then, what exactly was it she didn&#x2019;t want Carlo to do to her from behind?</p><p>Did that mean: from in front, okay, but not from behind?</p><p>He broke into a cold sweat.</p><p>He was tempted to wake Livia up, shake her roughly and, glaring wild-eyed, ask her in an imperious, cop-like voice:</p><p>&#x201c;Who is Carlo? Is he your lover?&#x201d;</p><p>But she was a woman, after all.</p><p>And therefore likely to deny everything, even when groggy with sleep. No, that would be a wrong move.</p><p>It was best to summon the strength to wait a while and try to broach the subject at the right moment.</p><p>But when was the right moment?</p><p>Anyway, he would need to have a certain amount of time at his disposal, since it would be a mistake to bring the question up directly. Livia would immediately go on the defensive. No, he needed to take a roundabout approach, without arousing any suspicion.</p><p>He decided to go and take a shower.</p><p>Going back to bed was now out of the question.</p><p>He was drinking his first coffee of the morning when the telephone rang.</p><p>By now it was eight o&#x2019;clock. He wasn&#x2019;t in the mood to hear about any little murders. If anything, he might kill somebody himself instead, given half a chance.</p><p>Preferably someone by the name of Carlo.</p><p>He&#x2019;d guessed right. It was Catarella.</p><p>&#x201c;Ahh Chief, Chief! Wha&#x2019;z ya doin&#x2019;, sleepin&#x2019;?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, Cat, I was awake.

I have to go out. I&#x2019;ll be back for lunch. Ciao.&#x201d;</p><p>He ran out to avoid starting a fight.</p><p>Via Cavour was in the part of Vig�ta where the rich people lived.</p><p>It had been designed by an architect who deserved a life sentence at the very least. One house looked like a Spanish galleon from the days of pirates, while the one beside it was clearly inspired by the Pantheon in Rome . . .</p><p>Montalbano pulled up in front of number 13, which looked like the Pyramid of Menkaure, got out of the car, and went into the building. On the left was a little booth of wood and glass with the porter in it.</p><p>&#x201c;Can you tell me what floor Mr. Piritone lives on?&#x201d;</p><p>The porter, a tall, burly man of about fifty who clearly spent a lot of time at the gym, set down the newspaper he was reading, took off his glasses, stood up, opened the door of the booth, and came out.</p><p>&#x201c;No need to bother,&#x201d; said Montalbano, &#x201c;all I need is&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All you need is for someone to bust your face,&#x201d; said the porter, raising a clenched fist.</p><p>Montalbano cringed and took a step back.</p><p>What was this guy&#x2019;s problem?</p><p>&#x201c;Wait, listen, there must be some kind of misunderstanding. I&#x2019;m looking for a Signor Piritone and I am&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You better make yourself scarce, and fast&#x2014;I mean it.&#x201d;</p><p>Montalbano lost patience.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Inspector Montalbano, goddammit!&#x201d;</p><p>The man looked surprised.</p><p>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Would you like to see my ID?&#x201d;</p><p>The porter turned red in the face.</p><p>&#x201c;Christ, it&#x2019;s true! Now I rec&#x2019;nize ya! I&#x2019;m sorry, I thought you were somebody tryin&#x2019; t&#x2019; fuck wit&#x2019; me. I apologize, sir. But look, there&#x2019;s nobody here named Piritone.&#x201d;</p><p>Naturally, Catarella, as usual, had given him the wrong name.</p><p>&#x201c;Is there anyone with a similar name?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a dottor Peritore.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That could be him. What floor?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Third.&#x201d;</p><p>The porter walked him to the elevator, endlessly excusing himself and bowing.</p><p>It occurred to Montalbano that one of these days Catarella, by screwing up every name he gave him, was going to get him shot by someone who was a little on edge.</p><p>The slender, blond, well-dressed, bespectacled man of about forty who opened the door for the inspector was not as obnoxious as the inspector had hoped.</p><p>&#x201c;Good morning, I&#x2019;m Montalbano.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Please come in, Inspector, just follow me. I was forewarned of your visit. Naturally the apartment is a mess; my wife and I didn&#x2019;t want to touch anything before you saw it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right, I should have a look around.&#x201d;</p><p>Bedroom, dining room, guest room, living room, study, kitchen, and two bathrooms, all turned upside down.</p><p>Armoires and cabinets thrown open, contents scattered all over the floor, a bookcase completely emptied, books strewn everywhere, desks and consoles with all their drawers open.</p><p>Policemen and burglars had one thing in common when searching somebody&#x2019;s home: even an earthquake left things in slightly better order.</p><p>In the kitchen was a young woman of about thirty, also blonde, pretty and polite.</p><p>&#x201c;This is my wife, Caterina.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Would you like some coffee?&#x201d; the woman asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Sure, why not?&#x201d; said the inspector.</p><p>After all, the kitchen was less topsy-turvy than any of the other rooms.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s best if we talk in here,&#x201d; said Montalbano, sitting down in a chair.</p><p>Peritore did the same.</p><p>&#x201c;The front door didn&#x2019;t look forced to me,&#x201d; the inspector continued. &#x201c;Did they come in through the windows?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, they just used our keys,&#x201d; said Peritore.</p><p>He stuck a hand in his pocket, took out a set of keys, and set them on the table.</p><p>&#x201c;They left them in the entrance hall.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. So you weren&#x2019;t home when the burglary occurred?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. Last night we slept at our seaside house, at Punta Piccola.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah. And how did you get in if the burglars had your keys?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I always keep an extra set with the porter.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, I don&#x2019;t quite understand. So where did the burglars get the keys they used to enter your apartment?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;From our seaside house.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;While you were asleep?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And they didn&#x2019;t steal anything from that house?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They certainly did.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So in fact there were two robberies?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I beg your pardon, Inspector,&#x201d; said Signora Caterina, pouring his coffee. &#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s better if I tell you. My husband is having trouble putting his thoughts in order. So. This morning we woke up around six, both of us with headaches. And we immediately realized that someone had broken in through the front door of our seaside home, knocked us out with some sort of gas, and had the run of the place.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t hear anything?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing at all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Strange.

So they quietly got into our car, came here, opened the door, stole what they wanted to steal, and went on their way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What did they take?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, aside from the car, they didn&#x2019;t take very much from the seaside house, relatively speaking. Our wedding rings, my husband&#x2019;s Rolex, my diamond-studded watch, a rather expensive necklace of mine, two thousand euros in cash, both of our computers, cell phones, and our credit cards, which we immediately had canceled.&#x201d;</p><p>Not very much?

After serving in the First World War, he embarked upon a distinguished academic career and was recognized as one of the finest philologists in the world. He was a professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford, a fellow of Pembroke College, and a fellow of Merton College until his retirement in 1959.

Over the two hundred years that followed, Islam and Christianity fought for dominion of the Holy Land, clashing in a succession of chillingly brutal wars: the Crusades. Here for the first time is the story of that epic struggle told from the perspective of both Christians and Muslims. A vivid and fast-paced narrative history, it exposes the full horror, passion, and barbaric grandeur of the Crusading era, revealing how these holy wars reshaped the medieval world and why they continue to influence events today.</p>Thomas Asbridge is a Reader in Medieval History at Queen Mary University in London, and an internationally renowned expert on the history of the Crusades.

Little has synthesized a vast body of specialized literature in Italian, German, French, and English to write an interpretive essay which provides a new perspective on the interaction between economic and social forces and the religious movements advocating the apostolic ideal of voluntary poverty...Little's book is a major contribution, not only to the history of the religious movement of voluntary poverty, but also to the interdisciplinary study of the middle ages." &#x2015;<i>Journal of Social History</i></p></p><p>Lester K. Little is Dwight W. Morrow Professor of History at Smith College. He is the author of numerous articles and books, including <i>Religious Poverty and the Profit Economy in Medieval Europe</i>, also from Cornell.<p>""This is a fascinating story of the role played by the religious ideal of voluntary poverty which initially through the monastic and eremitic movements rejected and condemned the new profit economy that developed with the cities, and then through the mendicant movements of radical poverty formed an urban spirituality that justified commerce...This book deserves to be in every library from public to graduate, for while the notes are a mine of scholarly erudition the text is eminently readable. Furthermore most studies relating religion to social and economic history are either limited in scope or written in German and French. Little, thoroughly acquainted with all these specialized studies as well as the medieval sources, has provided a creative synthesis that will take a major place among the classics of intellectual and social history. The excellent chapter on the origins of anti-Semitism in itself warrants purchase of the book.""</p> (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br><p>"Wickham&#x2019;s magisterial volume balances sweeping narrative with geographical and historical particularity. [...] Wickham&#x2019;s text is rich in Oxonian attention to detail, effectively conveying the epoch&#x2019;s incredible diversity, even as he refuses to give up on notions of shared cultural similarity. [...] Never boring, Medieval Europe functions primarily via the age-old art of storytelling, the relating of individual historical incidents to grand patterns and structures, the sort of bait that leaves a reader wanting to hear more&#x2015;a not immodest accomplishment for a book of only 250 pages."</p> (Chase Padusniak <i>MAKE Literary Magazine</i>)<br><br><p>""Little's interpretation of this complex situation is informed and well reasoned; it supplements rather than replaces any part of the large body of modern works on medieval economic history. Recommended for most academic libraries and religion collections.""</p> (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Lester K. Little's broad, interpretative essay is an account of the role played by voluntary poverty in the new profit economy of Western Europe between the eleventh and the fourteenth centuries. His particular interest is in the ways by which ideas of voluntary poverty helped shape a kind of spiritual life that accommodated the merchants, town dwellers, and clerics whom the new economy brought into prominence. The book is a synthesis of much of the most interesting and important recent medieval scholarship on theories of society, economics, morality, and lay and clerical spirituality, a good deal of which is by Little himself."</p> (<i>American Historical Review</i>)</p><h2>The Chicks with Sticks Guide to Crochet: Learn to Crochet with more than 30 Cool, Easy Patterns</h2><p>Join the clique of the Chicks with Sticks!<br>Anyone can do it.

And I continued to devour this wonderful series: THE QUESTION OF MAX, DEATH IN A TENURED POSITION, NO WORD FROM WINIFRED -- and onward.

Heilbrun, the revered Columbia University professor whose WRITING A WOMAN'S LIFE and other nonfiction volumes are recognized as ground-breaking classics in literary criticism and feminist studies. My admiration for the author grew and grew -- in both her guises. And then a few years ago, I had the great good fortune to become the editor of her "Amanda Cross" half.

In some areas, including much of Western Europe, longer summers brought bountiful crops and population growth that led to cultural flowering. In others, drought shook long-established societies, such as the Maya and the Indians of the American Southwest, whose monumental buildings were left deserted as elaborate social structures collapsed. Brian Fagan examines how subtle changes in the environment had far-reaching effects on human life, in a narrative that sweeps from the Arctic ice cap to the Sahara to the Indian Ocean. The lessons of history suggest we may be yet be underestimating the power of climate change to disrupt our lives today.</p><p>Brian Fagan was born in England and spent several years doing fieldwork in Africa. He is Emeritus Professor of Anthropology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He is the author of many books including<i> Fish on Friday: Feasting, Fasting, and the Discovery of the New World,</i> and several books on climate history, including <i>The Little Ice Age</i> and <i>The Long Summer</i>.<p>&#x201c;Fagan is a great guide.

Fagan's project is much bigger. He re-creates past societies in a lively and engaging manner, aided by his expert synthesis of obscure climatological data...In his ability to bring nature into our global, historical narratives, Fagan rivals Alfred Crosby, William H.

But as it turns out, a few less inches of rain, a change in temperature of just a degree or two can make all the difference in how human events unfold. <i>The Great Warming</i> demonstrates that although human beings make history, they very definitely do not make it under circumstances of their own choosing.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Ted Steinberg, author of Down to Earth: Nature's Role in American History and American Green: The Obsessive Quest for the Perfect Lawn</i></p><p>&#x201c;Anthropology and archaeology have demonstrated that human responses to changes in climate, no matter how severe, are always conditioned by culture and mediated by a society's institutions and technologies.

He lives in Tampa, FL. </p>Having previously taken on dirty politics and corporate scandal, Dorsey now skewers Hollywood in his eighth over-the-top novel. Serge Storms (who insists he's not a serial killer because he gets no joy out of it; he's just doing his duty) strikes again (<i>Torpedo Juice</i>;<i> Cadillac Beach</i>; etc.) with his strung-out sidekick, Coleman. Serge's new obsession is insisting that his beloved Florida be represented accurately in the movies and he's even taking a crack at writing a screenplay. He and Coleman end up in L.A., where mayhem ensues, most notably the kidnapping and murder of starlet Ally Street. Dorsey's cartoonish characters include the Glick brothers, slimy, coke-snorting owners of Vistamax Studios; ruthless director Werner B. Potemkin, whose over-budget/behind-schedule blockbusters cost people their lives; and unscrupulous agent Tori Gersh, who uses a rape accusation to secure a leading role for her client. Incorporating Ed McMahon and the prize van, Japanese investors and a trip to the Playboy Mansion, Dorsey takes wacky to a new level that readers will either love or hate. The litmus test is whether readers laugh when Serge tells the nursing home mogul he's about to kill that there is good news: "I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance." <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The spread of Renaissance values provided leading artists such as Gentile and Giovanni Bellini, Giorgione, Palladio, Titian, and Tintoretto with a licence for artistic invention. This inventiveness however also needs to be understood in relation to the artists and artworks that still conformed to the more traditional, corporate, and public values of "Venetianness"' (Venezianit�). <br><br>By adopting a chronological approach, with each chapter covering a successive twenty-five year period, and focusing attention on the artists, Tom Nichols presents a vivid and easily navigable study of Venetian Renaissance art. Through close visual analyses of specific works from architecture to illuminated manuscripts, he puts the formative power of art back at the heart of this remarkable story.</p><p>Tom Nichols is Reader in the History of Art and Head of Subject at the University of Glasgow.

For her twelfth birthday, Hills Aunt Pansy had one of her stories published in a book of short stories. This was the beginning of Hills career as a writer. In 1886, Hill and her family moved to Winter Park, Florida, where she got a job teaching gymnastics at a local college. She wrote her first real book there, in an effort to raise money for a family vacation to Chautauqua Lake. The book was called Chatauqua Idyl and was published in 1887 by D. Lothrop and Company, the same publisher that printed her first story when she was twelve. Hill was eventually married and began a family, but lost her husband to appendicitis. At this point in her life, her writing was the only means she had to keep food on the table and money in her pockets. In her lifetime, Hill wrote over a hundred books, only two of which were non-fiction. Grace Livingston Hill died in 1947 at the age of 82.</p><h2>The Quick Red Fox</h2><p>1987 Gold Medal edition paperback fine book In stock shipped from our UK warehouse</p><p>6 1-hour cassettesFrom the author of A Purple Place for Dying and The Deep Blue Good-by comes the republication of the bestseller starring Travis McGee, a real American hero.

Each writer, from his or her unique perspective, affirms the underlying truth that our true natures are wise, compassionate, and receptive.

First serial, The Washington Post.</p><p>The 2003 American invasion of Iraq was contentious, not just in the arena of global public opinion, but within the tight-lipped world of the George W. Bush White House. As Bob Woodward reveals in <i>Plan of Attack</i>, Vice-President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld were part of a group leading the charge to war while Secretary of State Colin Powell, General Tommy Franks, and others actively questioned the plan to invade a country that had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks while war in Afghanistan was still being waged. Woodward gained extensive access to dozens of key figures and enjoyed hours of direct contact with the President himself (more time, seemingly, than former Bush administration officials Richard Clarke and Paul O'Neill claim to have had). As a result, he's able to cite the kind of gossip you won't find in a White House press release: Franks calls Pentagon official Douglas Feith "the f*cking stupidest guy on the face of the earth," Powell shares his alarm over how the cautious Cheney of the first Bush administration had transformed into a zealot, and Saudi Ambassador Prince Bandar seems to enjoy significantly more entr�e and influence than most anyone would have thought. Bush is shown as a man intent on toppling Saddam Hussein in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 and never really wavering in his decision despite offering hints that non-military solutions could be achieved. Light is also shed on CIA director George Tenet, who insists that the evidence that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction was "a slam dunk" only to later admit that his intelligence was flawed when months of post-war searches turned up nothing. But the book's most interesting character is Powell. A former soldier himself, who finds himself increasingly at odds with the agenda of the administration, Powell rejects evidence on WMDs that he sees as spurious but ultimately endorses the invasion effort, apparently out of duty. Upon its publication, the Bush administration roundly denied many of the accounts in the book that demonstrated conflict within their circles, poor judgment, or lousy planning, but the Bush/Cheney reelection campaign nonetheless listed <i>Plan of Attack</i> as recommended reading. And it is. It shows alarming problems in the way the war was conceived and planned, but it also demonstrates the tremendous conviction and dedication of the people who decided to carry it out. <i>--John Moe</i><b>Bob Woodward</b> is Assistant Managing Editor at THE WASHINGTON POST.

They help us, teach us, heal us, and connect us to what matters. <i>As Far As the Heart Can See</i> is an invitation to be in relationship with deep and life-giving material. Poet and philosopher Mark Nepo reaches people through their hearts, bringing something fresh and new to the field by stimulating change through reflection of thoughts and feelings. The stories he shares in <i>As Far As the Heart Can See</i> come from many places--from Nepo's personal history to dreams to the myths of our ancestors.&nbsp;Each one is an invitation&nbsp;to awaken an aspect of living in relationship with the sacred.<br> Following each of the forty-five stories are three forms of an invitation to further the conversation: journal questions, table questions, and meditations. The questions, whether reflected upon in a journal or discussed in deeper conversation with friends or family, are meant to lead the seeker down unimagined paths and back into life; the meditations are meant to ground the learning. These stories and parables about universal concepts and themes offer a poet's sensuality and a philosopher's sensibility to personalizing the journey of the human experience in the world.</p><p>Mark Nepo is a poet and philosopher who has taught in the fields of poetry and spirituality for more than thirty years. In 1987, Mark was diagnosed with a rare form of lymphoma, and as he went through his cancer experience, the lack of books available to guide him through made a deep and lasting impression. As a result, Mark has since devoted himself to the usefulness of daily inner life.

Mann</p><h2>Slave Counterpoint: Black Culture in the Eighteenth-Century Chesapeake and Lowcountry (Published by the Omohundro Institute of Early American History ... and the University of North Carolina Press)</h2><p>On the eve of the American Revolution, nearly three-quarters of all African Americans in mainland British America lived in two regions: the Chesapeake, centered in Virginia, and the Lowcountry, with its hub in South Carolina. Here, Philip Morgan compares and contrasts African American life in these two regional black cultures, exploring the differences as well as the similarities. The result is a detailed and comprehensive view of slave life in the colonial American South.<br> Morgan explores the role of land and labor in shaping culture, the<br>everyday contacts of masters and slaves that defined the possibilities and limitations of cultural exchange, and finally the interior lives of blacks--their social relations, their family and kin ties, and the major symbolic dimensions of life: language, play, and religion. He provides a balanced appreciation for the oppressiveness of bondage <i>and</i> for the ability of slaves to shape their lives, showing that, whatever the constraints, slaves contributed to the making of their history. Victims of a brutal, dehumanizing system, slaves nevertheless strove to create order in their lives, to preserve their humanity, to achieve dignity, and to sustain dreams of a better future.<br><br></p><p>South Carolina in the 18th century was a colony that had been built on the back of slave labor. By contrast, Virginia only began to "recruit" slaves in large numbers at the beginning of that century. Consequently, although there were some similarities in the black cultures that emerged in the two regions, there were also substantial differences. Philip D. Morgan, a history professor at William and Mary, has produced an intricately detailed comparison of the Lowcountry and Chesapeake cultures that tells us much about the way of life of some of the earliest African Americans. <p> Looking at everything from the types of work the slaves performed to the houses in which they lived to the food they ate, Morgan reveals the patterned differences between the two slave societies; all slaves were exploited, but not all slaves were exploited alike. He also shows the differences within the societies; the slave experience would be much different for somebody who arrived directly from Africa than it would be for somebody who'd first spent time in the West Indies. </p><p> There are even some surprises: relations between the races in early Virginia, for example, were rather flexible, as black slaves came into regular contact with white indentured servants, and as Morgan writes, "the level of exploitation each group suffered inclined them to see the others as sharing their predicament." Furthermore, although there was sexual exploitation of black female slaves by their white masters, there was also a significant amount of <i>consensual</i> interracial sex, among white women and black men as well as white men and black women. That would change as the use of indentured servants declined while large quantities of slaves were imported directly from Africa and as various initiatives were launched by authorities to promote the social separation of the races. Chronicling the visible results of these and other phenomena in straightforward prose that is precise when possible and admits ambiguity when necessary, Morgan makes a crucial element of early American history far less remote to the modern reader.</p>"The closest [examination] yet made of slave life anywhere before the nineteenth century. . . . Morgan's account is exhaustive . . . in its detail, but it is more than a recovery of hard-to-find facts. It is informed throughout by Morgan's recognition that slavery, as an extreme form of domination, resonates with the ambiguities present in all human relations."-- <i>New York Review of Books</i> <br></p><h2>Home to Big Stone Gap: A Novel</h2><p>Millions of readers around the world have fallen in love with the novels of the New York Times bestselling author Adriana Trigiani. In<i> Home to Big Stone Gap</i>, she tells her most powerful story yet, full of humor and heart, wisdom and hope.<br><br>Nestled in the lush Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, the town of Big Stone Gap has been home for Ave Maria Mulligan Machesney and her family for generations. She&#x2019;s been married to her beloved Jack for nearly twenty years, raised one child and buried another, and run a business that binds her community together, all while holding her tight circle of family and friends close. <br><br>But with her daughter, Etta, having flown the nest to enchanting Italy, Ave Maria has reached a turning point. When a friend&#x2019;s postcard arrives with the message &#x201c;It&#x2019;s time to live your life for you,&#x201d; Ave Maria realizes that it&#x2019;s time to go in search of brand-new dreams. But before she can put her foot on the path, her life is turned upside down. <br><br>Ave Maria agrees to helm the town musical, a hilarious reunion of local talent past and present. A lifelong friendship collapses when a mysterious stranger comes to town and reveals a long-buried secret. An unexpected health crisis threatens her family. An old heartthrob reappears, challenging her marriage and offering a way out of her troubles. An opportunistic coal company comes to town and threatens to undermine the town&#x2019;s way of life and the mountain landscape Ave Maria has treasured since she was a girl. Now she has no choice but to reinvent her world, her life, and herself, whether she wants to or not. <br>Trigiani is at her best in this exquisite page-turner. <i>Home to Big Stone Gap</i> is an emotional and unforgettable journey that reminds us that you can go home again and again. <br><br>From <i>BOOKLIST</i><br><b>*STAR* Trigiani, Adriana.</b> Home to Big Stone Gap. Nov. 2006. 301p. Random, $25.95 (1-4000-6008-7). <br>Tucked in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia is Big Stone Gap, the bucolic backdrop for Trigiani&#x2019;s popular series. In this fourth entry, Ave Maria Mulligan MacChesney and her husband, Jack, must come to terms with the absence of daughter Etta, newly married and living in Italy. (The country holds a special place in Ave Maria&#x2019;s heart: her biological father, Mario, whom she learned of and met only after her mother&#x2019;s death, is Italian). Ave Maria has plenty to keep her mind off missing her only child (the MacChesney&#x2019;s son, Joe, died of leukemia at age four). She&#x2019;s a full-time pharmacist and the newly appointed director of the town&#x2019;s annual musical. Then comes news that her longtime friend, glamorous librarian Iva Lou, has been keeping a startling secret for nearly 20 years. Other developments, including a health scare for Jack and a Christmas visit from a colorful former resident, move the plot along briskly. With her original cast of characters, playwright and television writer Trigiani blends playfulness and pathos in this evocative portrait of a small southern town. Fans of the Big Stone Gap series can look forward to a feature film; Trigiani has written the screenplay and is slated to direct. &#x2013;<i>Allison Block<br>"</i>Is there ever trouble for Ave Maria Mulligan MacChesney, heroine of Trigiani's beloved Big Stone Gap novels, starting with her married daughter's move to Italy and leading right up to a stranger's disturbing appearance in town."&#x2013;<i>Library Journal</i><br><br>Praise for the Big Stone Gap novels:<br>&#x201c;Delightfully quirky . . . chock-full of engaging, oddball characters and unexpected plot twists.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>People</i> (Book of the Week)<br><br>&#x201c;Funny, charming, and original.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Fannie Flagg<br><br>&#x201c;Satisfying reading . . .

As I wake, for a split second, I forget where I am. As soon as I see our suitcases piled next to the closet door, in the exact place where we dropped them, I remember. Etta&#x2019;s wedding, though it was just one week ago, already seems like a faraway dream.<br><br>When we drove up the road last night, our home in Cracker&#x2019;s Neck Holler looked like a castle in the mist. The first days of autumn always bring the cold fog, which makes every twist and turn on these mountain roads treacherous. Etta used to call the September fog the Murky Murk. She told me, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like it when I can&#x2019;t see the mountains, Mama.&#x201d;<br><br>This morning they&#x2019;re in plain view again. Since we&#x2019;ve been gone, the mossy field out back has turned to brown velvet, and the woods beyond have a silver patina from the first frost. I take a deep breath.<br><br>In a way, it&#x2019;s good to be home, where everything is in its place. The same beam of sunlight that comes over the mountain at dawn splits our house in two, one half drenched in brightness and the other in dark shadow. Shoo the Cat sleeps on the same embroidered pillow on the old rocker, as he has every night since he came to stay. Small, familiar comforts matter when everything is changing.<br><br>I pull on my robe. Before I leave the room, I tuck the quilt around my husband. He&#x2019;s not waking up anytime soon; his breath is rhythmic and deep. I make my way through the stone house, and it feels so empty &#x2014;as it did before there were children. I don&#x2019;t know if there is a sound lonelier than the silence of everybody gone.<br><br>The first thing I do is measure the coffee into the old two-part pot Papa gave me from a shop in Schilpario. I put the pot on the stove, and blue gas flames shoot up when I turn the dial. It&#x2019;s chilly, so I take a long, thin match from the box on the mantel and light the fire in the hearth. One of the things I love best about my husband is that he never leaves a fireplace barren. No matter what time of year, there&#x2019;s a crisscross of dry logs on a bed of kindling and a neat newspaper bundle good to go. The paper crackles, and soon the logs catch and the flames leap up like laughter from a school yard.<br><br>There&#x2019;s a note on the fridge from my friend Iva Lou: Welcome home. How was it? Call me. When I look inside, she&#x2019;s stocked us for breakfast: a few of Faye Pobst&#x2019;s rolls (I can tell by the shape of the tinfoil package), a jar of fresh jam, a crock of country butter, and a glass carafe of fresh cream, no doubt from her aunt&#x2019;s farm down in Rose Hill. What would I do without Iva Lou? I really don&#x2019;t like to think about it, but I do; in fact, I&#x2019;ve been obsessed with loss lately. The past year brought my happy circus to an abrupt close&#x2014;Spec died, Pearl moved to Boston, and I lost Etta to her new life in Italy. I don&#x2019;t like change. I said that so much, Jack Mac finally said, &#x201c;Get used to it.&#x201d; Doesn&#x2019;t make it one bit easier, though, not one bit.<br><br>There&#x2019;s a deep stack of mail waiting for me on the table. Bills. Flyers. A letter from Saint Mary&#x2019;s College requesting alumnae donations. An envelope for Jack from the United Mine Workers of America&#x2014;another cut in benefits, no doubt. A puffy envelope from the home shopping channel containing a pair of earrings I bought for Fleeta&#x2019;s birthday on back-order (took long enough). Underneath is a postcard from Schilpario, Italy, the town we&#x2019;d just left a day ago. I flip it over quickly and read:<br><br>Dear Ave Maria,<br><br>By the time you get this, Etta will be married, you&#x2019;ll be home, and I&#x2019;ll be back in New York. This is a reminder. Start living your life for YOU. Got it? Love, Theodore.<br><br>I put the postcard from my best pal under a magnet on the door of the fridge. I&#x2019;ll take any free advice I can get. Noticing the clutter on the door&#x2014;all reminders of my daughter and her senior year of high school&#x2014;I begin to take things down. Etta&#x2019;s high school graduation schedule from last June is taped to a ribbon of photos she took in a booth at the Fort Henry Mall. She looks like a girl in the pictures. Her coppery hair in long braids makes her seem even younger. She is young, too young to be married, and too young to be so far from home. I close my eyes. Is it ever really possible for a mother to let go?<br><br>The coffee churns up into the cap of the pot, signaling it&#x2019;s ready to be poured. I grab an oven mitt off its hook and pour the coffee into the mug. The delicious scent of a hickory fire and fresh-roasted coffee is the perfect welcome home.<br><br>I kick the screen door open and go out on the porch to watch the sun take its place in the sky over Big Stone Gap. Autumn is my favorite time of year; it seems to say &#x201c;Let go&#x201d; with every leaf that turns and falls to the ground and every dingy cloud that rolls by overhead. Let go. (So hard to do when your nature tells you to hang on.)<br><br>At the edge of the woods, a spindly dead branch high in a treetop crackles under the weight of a blackbird, which flies off into the charcoal sky until it&#x2019;s a speck in the distance. I have to remind Jack that the property line needs some attention. He&#x2019;s always so busy fixing other people&#x2019;s houses that our needs are last on the list. The wild raspberry bushes have taken over the far side of the field, a tangled mess of wires and vines. Pruning, composting, raking&#x2014;all those chores will occupy us until the winter comes.<br><br>I hear more snapping coming from the woods, so I squint at the treetops, expecting more blackbirds, but there is no movement. The sound seems to be coming from the ground. I lean forward as I sit and study the woods. I hear more crackling. What is it? I wonder. Then something strange happens: I have a moment of fear. I know there&#x2019;s nothing to be afraid of&#x2014;the sun is up, Jack is inside, and there&#x2019;s a working phone in the kitchen&#x2014;but for some reason, I shudder.<br><br>As I stand to go back into the house, I see a figure in the woods. It looks like a man. A young man. With curly brown hair. I can see that much from my place on the porch, but not much else&#x2014;his face is obscured behind the thick branches. I raise my hand to wave to him, and open my mouth to shout to him, but as soon as I do, he is gone. I close my eyes and listen for more footsteps. There is nothing but silence.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you doing out here?&#x201d; Jack says from the door. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s cold. Come inside.&#x201d;<br><br>I follow him into the house. Once we&#x2019;re in the kitchen, I throw my arms around him. &#x201c;Honey, I saw something. Someone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In the woods.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right now. This second. He was walking along the property line. I saw him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s hunting season.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He wasn&#x2019;t a hunter.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe he&#x2019;s hiking.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What, then?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was Joe.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Joe?&#x201d; Jack Mac is confused&#x2014;so confused, he sits. &#x201c;Our Joe?&#x201d;<br><br>I nod.<br><br>&#x201c;Jesus, Ave Maria. You know that&#x2019;s impossible.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; My eyes fill with tears. &#x201c;But I think I&#x2019;d know my son when I see him.&#x201d;<br><br>Without hesitating, Jack takes his work jacket off the hook, pulls it on, and goes outside. I watch him as he walks across the field and into the woods. He surveys our property line, looking for the young man. Sometimes he takes a few steps into the woods and disappears. I don&#x2019;t know why, but I&#x2019;m relieved each time he reemerges. I stand at the window waiting as he checks the side yard and his wood shop. I half expect him to return with someone. With Joe. I hear the bang of the screen door.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no one there. It was a long trip. You&#x2019;re tired. You&#x2019;re imagining things. Really.&#x201d; Jack takes off his jacket. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t see any footprints in the mud. Nothing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not making it up.&#x201d;<br><br>Jack sits and pulls me onto his lap. &#x201c;What did he look like?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He wasn&#x2019;t four years old, like when he died, but older. Like twenty.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You know that can&#x2019;t be.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; I stand up. I go to the stove and pour a cup of coffee into a mug and hand it to him. I pull the rolls from the tinfoil and put them on a baking sheet. I slide them into the oven to warm them.<br><br>&#x201c;It was someone else,&#x201d; Jack says practically as he sorts the mail.<br><br>&#x201c;Or it wasn&#x2019;t anybody. My eyes played a trick on me. I hadn&#x2019;t even had my coffee, and I&#x2019;m half asleep here in my big fat empty nest. I miss Etta, and that always makes me miss Joe.&#x201d; I pull the rolls from the oven.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to lose it on me, are you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not crazy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good.&#x201d; Jack Mac smiles at me. &#x201c;I can handle just about anything but a crazy woman.&#x201d; He tosses the junk mail into the fire.<br><br>I slather the rolls with butter and jam. Jack studies a bill from the mail, so I feed him the roll. He takes a bite; I turn to get a plate. Jack grabs my hand and licks the jam off my finger. I look into his eyes and see the exact color of the morning sky. He looks at me in that way he never looks at anyone else. With all we&#x2019;ve been through, that look still delights me. &#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; I ask him, but after nineteen years of marriage, I have a pretty good idea.<br><br>He doesn&#x2019;t answer; instead, he kisses my neck and loosens the belt on my robe, which conveniently drops to the floor&#x2014;I say &#x201c;conveniently&#x201d; because I&#x2019;m still holding the roll, which I lob i...</p><h2>Fabricating Jesus: How Modern Scholars Distort the Gospels</h2><p>Modern historical study of the Gospels seems to give us a new portrait of Jesus every spring--just in time for Easter. The more unusual the portrait, the more it departs from the traditional view of Jesus, the more attention it gets in the popular media. Why are scholars so prone to fabricate a new Jesus? Why is the public so eager to accept such claims without question? What methods and assumptions predispose scholars to distort the record? Is there a more sober approach to finding the real Jesus? Commenting on such recent releases as Bart Ehrman's <em>Misquoting Jesus,</em> James Tabor's <em>The Jesus Dynasty,</em> Michael Baigent's <em>The Jesus Papers</em> and <em>The Gospel of Judas,</em> for which he served as an advisory board member to the National Geographic Society, Craig Evans offers a sane approach to examining the sources for understanding the historical Jesus.</p><p>&#34;Craig Evans is well-known in academic circles for his expertise in Judaism and the history of early Christianity. In this new book he brings a refreshing mixture of scholarly erudition and critical common sense to an evaluation of the various documents that have been thought to undermine the credibility of the New Testament and demonstrates convincingly that they cannot bear the burden of proof that has been placed upon them. Such documents as the Gospels of Thomas and Peter have no significant new light to shed on the historical Jesus. At a time when much baseless fiction is being developed by novelists on the basis of such dubious sources, it is good to have this expos� of just how fictitious such writings are.&#34;Features &amp; Benefits <p>* Craig A.

She's relieved to accept an apparently straightforward assignment from an old friend to investigate certain matters concerning a potential land purchase.</p><p>Her inquiries take her to a picturesque village in Kent during the hop-picking season. But beneath its pastoral surface, Maisie finds evidence that something is amiss. Mysterious fires erupt in the village with alarming regularity, and a series of petty crimes suggests a darker criminal element at work. As Maisie discovers, the villagers are bitterly prejudiced against outsiders who flock to Kent at harvest time -- even more troubling, they seem possessed by the legacy of a wartime Zeppelin raid. Growing increasingly suspicious of a peculiar secrecy that shrouds the village, Maisie ultimately must draw on all her finely honed skills of detection to solve one of her most intriguing cases.</p></p><p><p><b>Jacqueline Winspear</b><b>&nbsp;</b>is the author of four previous Maisie Dobbs novels.

Originally from the United Kingdom, Winspear now lives in California.</p><p>PROLOGUE</p><p><i>Early September </i><i>1931</i></p><p>The old woman rested on the steps of her home, a caravan set apart from those of the rest of her family, her tribe. She pulled a clay pipe from her pocket, inspected the dregs of tobacco in the small barrel, shrugged, and struck a match against the rim of a water butt tied to the side of her traveling home. She lit the pipe with ease, clamping her ridged lips around the end of the long stem to draw vigor from the almost-spent contents. A lurcher lay at the foot of the steps, seeming at first to be asleep, though the old woman knew that one ear was cocked to the wind, one eye open and watching her every move.</p><p>Aunt Beulah Webb&#x2014;that was the name she was known by, for an older gypsy woman was always known as <i>aunt </i>to those younger&#x2014;sucked on her pipe and squinted as she surveyed the nearby fields, then cast her eyes to the hop-gardens beyond. The hops would be hanging heavy on the bine by now, rows upon rows of dark-green, spice-aroma&#x2019;d swags, waiting to be harvested, picked by the nimble hands of men, women and children alike, most of whom came from London for a working late-summer holiday. Others were gypsies like herself, and the rest were <i>gorja </i>from the surrounding villages. Gorja. More house dwellers, more who were not gypsies.</p><p>Her people kept themselves to themselves, went about their business without inviting trouble. Aunt Beulah hoped the <i>diddakoi </i>families kept away from the farm this year. A Roma would trust anyone before a diddakoi&#x2014;before the half-bred people who were born of gypsy and gorja. As far as she was concerned, they looked for trouble, expected it. They were forgetting the old ways, and there were those among them who left the dregs of their life behind them when they moved on, their caravans towed by boneshaker lorries, not horses. The woman looked across at the caravan of the one she herself simply called Webb. Her son. Of course, her son&#x2019;s baby daughter, Boosul, was a diddakoi, by rights, though with her shock of ebony hair and pebble-black eyes, she favored Roma through and through.</p><p>About her business in the morning, Beulah brought four tin bowls from underneath the caravan&#x2014;underneath the <i>vardo </i>in the gypsy tongue. One bowl was used to wash tools used in the business of eating, one for the laundering of clothes, one for water that touched her body, and another for the cleaning of her vardo. It was only when she had completed those tasks, fetching dead wood from the forest for the fire to heat the water, that she finally placed an enamel kettle among the glowing embers and waited for it to boil for tea. Uneasy unless working, Beulah bound bunches of Michaelmas daisies to sell door to door, then set them in a basket and climbed back into her vardo.</p><p>She knew the village gorja, those out about their errands, would turn their backs when they saw her on the street, would glance away from her black eyes and dark skin now rippled with age. They would look aside so as not to stare at her gold hoop earrings, the scarf around her head, and the wide gathered skirt of threadbare deep-purple wool that marked her as a gypsy. Sometimes children would taunt.</p><p>&#x201c;Where are you going, pikey? Can&#x2019;t you hear, you old gyppo woman?&#x2019;</p><p>But she would only have to stare, perhaps point a charcoal blackened finger, and utter words in dialect that came from deep in the throat, a low grumble of language that could strike fear into the bravest bully&#x2014;and they would be gone.</p><p>Women were the first to turn away, though there were always a few&#x2014;enough to make it worth her while&#x2014;who would come to the door at her knock, press a penny into her outstretched hand, and take a bunch of the daisies with speed lest their fingers touch her skin. Beulah smiled. She would see them again soon enough. When dusk fell, a twig would snap underfoot as a visitor approached her vardo with care. The lurcher would look up, a bottomless growl rumbling in her gullet. Beulah would reach down and place her hand on the dog&#x2019;s head, whispering, &#x201c;<i>Shhhh, jook</i>.&#x201d; She would wait until the steps were closer, until she could hold the lurcher no longer, and then would call out, &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s there?&#x201d; And, after a second or two, a voice, perhaps timid, would reply, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve come for my fortune.&#x201d;</p><p>Beulah would smile as she uncovered the glass sphere she&#x2019;d brought out and set on the table at eventide, waiting.</p><p>Not that a ball made of a bit of glass had anything to do with it, yet that was what was expected. The gypsy might not have been an educated woman, but she knew what sold. She didn&#x2019;t need glass, or crystal, a bit of amethyst, a cup of still-wet tea leaves, or a rabbit&#x2019;s foot to see, either. No, those knickknacks were for the customers, for those who needed to witness her using something solid, because the thought of her seeing pictures of what was to come in thin air would be enough to send them running. And you never scared away money.</p><p>Beulah heard a squeal from the tent that leaned against her son&#x2019;s vardo, little Boosul waking from sleep. Her people were stirring, coming out to light fires, to make ready for the day. True gypsies never slept in their spotless vardos, with shining brass and wafer-thin china hanging from the walls. Like Beulah, they lived in tents, hardy canvas tied across a frame of birch or ash. The vardos were kept for best. Beulah looked up to the rising sun, then again at the fields as the steamy mist of warming dew rose to greet the day. She didn&#x2019;t care for the people of this village, Heronsdene. She saw the dark shadow that enveloped each man and woman and trailed along, weighing them down as they went about their daily round. There were ghosts in this village&#x2014;ghosts who would allow the neighbors no rest.</p><p>As she reached down to pour scalding water into the teapot, the old woman&#x2019;s face concertina&#x2019;d as a throbbing pain and bright light bore down upon her with no warning, a sensation with which she was well familiar. She dropped the kettle back into the embers and pressed her bony knuckles hard against her skull, squeezing her eyes shut against flames that licked up behind her closed eyelids. <i>Fire</i>. <i>Again</i>. She fought for breath, the heat rising up around</p><p>her feet to her waist, making her old legs sweat, her hands clammy. And once more she came to Beulah, walking out from the very heart of the inferno, the younger woman she had not yet met but knew would soon come. It would not be long now; the time approached&#x2014;of that she was sure. The woman was tall and well dressed, with black hair&#x2014;not long hair, but not as short as she&#x2019;d seen on some of the gorja womenfolk in recent years. Beulah leaned against the vardo, the lurcher coming to stand at her mistress&#x2019;s side as if to offer her lean body as buttress. This woman, who walked amid the flames of Beulah&#x2019;s imagination, had known sadness, had lived with death. And though she now stepped forward alone, the grief was lifting&#x2014;Beulah could see it ascending like the morning cloud, rising up to leave her in peace. She was strong, this woman of her dreams, and . . . Beulah shook her head. The vision was fading; the woman had turned away from her, back into the flames, and was gone.</p><p>The gypsy matriarch held one hand against her forehead, still leaning against her vardo. She opened her eyes with care and looked about her. Only seconds had passed, yet she had seen enough to know that a time of great trouble was almost upon her. She believed the woman&#x2014;the woman for whom she waited&#x2014;would be her ally, though she could not be sure. She <i>was </i>sure of three things, though&#x2014;that the end of her days drew ever closer, that before she breathed her last, a woman she had never seen in her life would come to her, and that this woman, even though she might think of herself as ordinary, of little account in the wider world, still followed Death as he made his rounds. That was her calling, her work, what she was descended of gorja and gypsy to do. And Beulah Webb knew that here, in this place called Heronsdene, Death would walk among them soon enough, and there was nothing she could do to prevent such fate. She could only do her best to protect her people.</p><p>The sun was higher in the sky now. The gypsy folk would bide their time for three more days, then move to a clearing at the edge of the farm, setting their vardos and pitching their tents away from Londoners, who came for the picking to live in whitewashed hopper huts and sing their bawdy songs around the fire at night. And though she would go about her business, Beulah would be waiting&#x2014;waiting for the woman with her modern clothes and her tidy hair. Waiting for the woman whose sight, she knew, was as powerful as her own.</p></p><h2>USGBC LEED Green Associate Study Guide</h2><p>On 3 practice quizzes I circled answers.

And thus, we can see where the Church's journey begins in history. Pope Benedict XVI<br><br>The Fathers of the Church exhorted believers in the face of persecution while fighting heresies and misunderstandings. They were theologians and philosophers, orators and pastors, leaders and problem solvers, martyrs and heroes. <br>Pope Benedict carefully explains the stories of their rich history and the vital role each one played in not only preserving the Church at the time, but anchoring the Church of today as well as the future. <br><br>Bring your faith to life with the spark of history as told by the Pope himself. Gain a fuller understanding of what the Church teaches and why through the critical efforts and experiences of our early Church fathers. <br><br>Saint Clement, Bishop of Rome . . . Saint Ignatius of Antioch . . . Origen of Alexandria . . . Saint John Chrysostom . . .Saint Basil...Saint Gregory Nazianzus...St. Maximus of Turin...and more.<br><br>These illustrious Church Fathers are the first and second generations of the Church following the Apostles. It is upon their backs that the Church's journey through history is established and solidified. <br><br>By defending the newborn Christianity to the point of death and explaining the content of the Faith in a language understandable to the masses, the Apostolic Fathers created a timeless anchor of faith that extends through the challenges of today.</p><p>Pope Benedict XVI, born Joseph Alois Ratzinger in 1927,served as the 265th Pope of the Roman Catholic Churchfrom April 2005 through February 2013. Formerly he wasDean of the College of Cardinals, Prefect of theCongregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, and President ofthe International Theological Commission. An outstandingtheologian and teacher, he was one of the founders, alongwith Hans Urs von Balthasar and Henri de Lubac, of theinternational Catholic journal Communio, and he hasalso enjoyed a distinguished teaching career at suchuniversities as T?bingen and Regensburg in his homecountry of Germany.<b>Matthew Levering</b><br><i>University of Dayton</i><br> "Benedict XVI is a pope of theological ressourcement in the sense that he aims to place the Scriptures and the patristic heritage at the center of the Church's life. Reading these portraits of Church Fathers, one is struck by how their minds and hearts were aflame with love for Christ Jesus as revealed in Scripture. To love God and neighbor in Christ and his Spirit &#x2014; this is the quest to which these extraordinary people dedicated their lives. Through Benedict's highly readable teachings, skillfully edited by Joseph Lienhard, the Fathers come alive; Christ Jesus lives in them and calls to us."</p><h2>Knight&#39;s Shadow (The Greatcoats, 2)</h2><p>Following his beloved debut, <i>Traitor's Blade,</i> Sebastien de Castell returns with volume two of his fast-paced fantasy adventure series, inspired by the swashbuckling action and witty banter of <i>The Three Musketeers.</i> <i>Knight's Shadow</i> continues the series with a thrilling and dark tale of heroism and betrayal in a country crushed under the weight of its rulers' corruption.<br>A few days after the horrifying murder of a duke and his family, Falcio val Mond, swordsman and First Cantor of the Greatcoats, begins a deadly pursuit to capture the killer.

The morning four weeks after Patriana, Duchess of Hervor had poisoned me was not one of those times.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d;</p><p>Despite the fog clogging my head and dulling the sounds in my ears, I recognized Brasti&#x2019;s voice.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not dead,&#x201d; said another, slightly deeper voice. That one belonged to Kest.</p><p>The light thump-thump of Brasti&#x2019;s footsteps on the wooden floor of the cottage grew louder. &#x201c;Usually he comes out of it by now. I&#x2019;m telling you, this time he&#x2019;s dead. Look: he&#x2019;s barely breathing.&#x201d;</p><p>A finger prodded at my chest, then my cheek, then my eye.</p><p>You might be wondering why I didn&#x2019;t simply stab Brasti and go back to sleep; first, my rapiers were ten feet away, lying on a bench next to the door of the small cottage we occupied. Second, I couldn&#x2019;t move.</p><p>&#x201c;Stop poking at him,&#x201d; Kest said. &#x201c;Barely breathing still means <i>alive</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&#x201c;Which is another thing,&#x201d; Brasti said. &#x201c;Neatha&#x2019;s supposed to be fatal.&#x201d; I imagined him wagging his finger at me. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re all happy you survived it, Falcio, but this lying about each morning is highly inconvenient behavior. One might even call it selfish.&#x201d;</p><p>Despite my repeated attempts, my hands refused to reach out and wrap themselves around Brasti&#x2019;s throat.</p><p>The first week after I&#x2019;d been poisoned, I&#x2019;d noticed a slight weakness in my limbs&#x2014;I moved more slowly than usual. Sometimes I&#x2019;d try to move my hand and it would take a second before it would obey. But instead of getting better, the condition had gradually worsened and I found myself imprisoned in my own body for longer and longer each morning after I awoke.</p><p>A hand on my chest pressed down with a great deal of pressure: Brasti was leaning on me. &#x201c;But Kest, I think you have to agree that Falcio is <i>largely</i> dead.&#x201d;</p><p>There was another pause and I knew Kest was considering the matter. The problem with Brasti is that he&#x2019;s an idiot. He&#x2019;s handsome and charming; he can outshoot any man or woman with a bow, and he&#x2019;s an idiot. Oh, you wouldn&#x2019;t think so at first; he&#x2019;s a fine conversationalist and uses many words that sound like the sort of words smart people use. He just doesn&#x2019;t use them in the right context. Or even the right order.</p><p>The problem with Kest, though, is that while he is extremely intelligent, he thinks that &#x201c;being philosophical&#x201d; requires giving any idea due consideration, even if it&#x2019;s utterly nonsensical and being uttered by the aforementioned idiot.</p><p>&#x201c;I suppose,&#x201d; Kest said finally, and then redeemed himself marginally by adding, &#x201c;But wouldn&#x2019;t it be more correct to say he&#x2019;s somewhat <i>alive</i>?&#x201d;</p><p>More silence. Did I mention that the two fools in question are my best friends, fellow Greatcoats, and the men I was counting on to protect me in case the Lady Trin picked that precise moment to send her Knights after us?</p><p>I suppose I should get used to calling her <i>Duchess</i> Trin now. After all, I&#x2019;d killed her mother, Patriana (yes, the one who&#x2019;d poisoned me)&#x2014;in my defense, I was trying to protect the King&#x2019;s heir at the time. I suspect that&#x2019;s the real source of Trin&#x2019;s grievance with me, as the presence of a genuine monarch gets in the way of her scheme to take the throne for herself.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s still not moving,&#x201d; Brasti said. &#x201c;I really think he might be dead this time.&#x201d; I felt his hand brush a rather private part of my body and realized he was searching my pockets for money&#x2014;which Proves yet again that hiring a former poacher to be a traveling magistrate</p><p>had not necessarily been one of the King&#x2019;s best ideas. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re out of food, by the way,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I thought those damned villagers were supposed to be bringing us supplies.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Be grateful they&#x2019;re letting us hide here in the first place,&#x201d; Kest said placidly. &#x201c;Feeding more than a hundred Greatcoats is a heavy burden for a village this small. Besides, they did bring food&#x2014;from their winter caches in the mountains, just a few minutes ago. The Tailor&#x2019;s managing distribution.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then why don&#x2019;t I hear brats running around screaming and annoying us, asking to borrow our swords&#x2014;or worse, play with my bows?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps they heard you complaining? They left their families in the mountains this morning.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s something anyway.&#x201d;</p><p>I felt Brasti&#x2019;s fingers pulling the lid of my right eye back, and white light blinded me. Then the fingers went away and the light disappeared.</p><p>&#x201c;How long until Falcio&#x2019;s <i>mostly</i> alive and no longer <i>entirely</i> useless? I mean, what happens when Trin&#x2019;s Knights learn about this? Or Dashini assassins? Or anyone else, for that matter?&#x201d; Brasti&#x2019;s voice was growing more anxious as he spoke. &#x201c;You name any group of people out there who know how to kill a man horribly and I&#x2019;ll bet you good gold that Falcio&#x2019;s made an enemy of them. Any one of them could&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>I felt my heart moving faster and faster, and tried to force my breathing to slow down, but panic was beginning to overtake me.</p><p>&#x201c;Stop talking, Brasti. You&#x2019;re making him worse.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll come for him, Kest, you know it&#x2014;they might even be coming now. Are you going to kill every single one of them?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If that is what&#x2019;s required.&#x201d; You can hear a coldness in Kest&#x2019;s voice when he talks that way.</p><p>&#x201c;You might be the Saint of Swords now, but you&#x2019;re still just one man. You can&#x2019;t fight an army. And what happens if Falcio&#x2019;s condition gets worse, and he just stops breathing? What happens when we&#x2019;re not here and&#x2014;?&#x201d;</p><p>I heard the sound of a scuffle and felt the bed shake a bit as someone was pushed up against the wall.</p><p>&#x201c;Take your Gods-damned hands off me, Kest! Saint or no, I&#x2019;ll&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m scared for him too, Brasti,&#x201d; Kest said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re all scared.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s . . . By all the hells we&#x2019;ve been to&#x2014;he&#x2019;s supposed to be the smart one. How in the name of Saint Laina&#x2019;s left tit did he let himself get poisoned <i>again</i>?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To save her,&#x201d; Kest said. &#x201c;To save Aline.&#x201d;</p><p>There was silence for a few moments and for the first time that morning I couldn&#x2019;t envision Kest and Brasti&#x2019;s faces. It was troubling, as if perhaps my hearing had suddenly gone away too. Fortunately, silence is a condition Brasti&#x2019;s never been able to abide for long.</p><p>&#x201c;And that&#x2019;s another thing,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;if he&#x2019;s so damned brilliant then why is it that all anyone has to do to get him to risk his life for a girl he&#x2019;s never met before is just name her after his dead wife?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s the King&#x2019;s heir, Brasti, and if you talk about Falcio&#x2019;s wife again you&#x2019;ll discover there are worse things than being paralyzed.&#x201d;</p><p><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;d take the chance if I thought it would bring him out of this,&#x201d; Brasti said. &#x201c;Damn it, Kest! He is the smart one. Trin&#x2019;s got armies and assassins and damned fucking Dukes on her side and we&#x2019;ve got nothing. How are we supposed to put a thirteen-year- old girl on the throne with Falcio in this condition?&#x201d;</p><p>I felt my eyes begin to flutter some more, and empty gray started flashing to bright white and back again, over and over. The effect was a little disconcerting.</p><p>&#x201c;I suppose you and I will have to try to be smarter,&#x201d; Kest said.</p><p>&#x201c;And just how do you propose we go about that?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&#x201c;Well, how does Falcio do it?&#x201d;</p><p>There was a long pause, then Brasti started, &#x201c;He . . . well, he figures things out, doesn&#x2019;t he? You know, there&#x2019;ll be six things going on, none of which seem all that important, and then all of a sudden he&#x2019;ll jump up and declare that assassins are coming or a Lord Caravaner must&#x2019;ve bribed a City Constable or whatever.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then that&#x2019;s what you and I need to do,&#x201d; Kest said. &#x201c;We need to start figuring those things out before they happen.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, what&#x2019;s happening right now?&#x201d;</p><p>Brasti snorted. &#x201c;Well, Trin&#x2019;s got five thousand soldiers on her side and the backing of at least two powerful duchies. We&#x2019;ve got about a hundred Greatcoats and the tepid support of the creaky old Duke of Pulnam. Oh, and right about now she&#x2019;s probably having a nice breakfast and going over her plans for taking the throne while we sit here starving, hiding out in this shitty little village watching Falcio do his best impression of a corpse. And I am starving.&#x201d;</p><p>There was silence again. I tried to move a finger. I don&#x2019;t think I succeeded, but now I could feel the rough wool of the blanket on my fingertip. That was a good sign.</p><p>&#x201c;At least you aren&#x2019;t having to listen to screaming children,&#x201d; Kest said.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s that.&#x201d;</p><p>I heard the sound of Kest&#x2019;s footsteps as he approached me and felt a hand on my shoulder. &#x201c;So what do you suppose Falcio would make of all that? What does it all mean?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It means . . .&#x201d; There was a long pause before Brasti finally said, &#x201c;nothing. It&#x2019;s all just a bunch of unconnected details, none of which have anything to do with the others. Do you suppose that maybe Falcio just pretends to be clever and no one&#x2019;s caught on yet?&#x201d;</p><p>I wanted to laugh at Brasti&#x2019;s frustration, then I felt the small muscles at the edges of my mouth twitch, just a bit. Oh, Gods, I&#x2019;m coming out of it. <i>Move</i>, I told myself. <i>Get out of bed and go and help the Tailor defeat Trin&#x2019;s army. Put Aline on the throne, and then get out of this business of politics and war and go back to judging land disputes over whose cow farted on whose field, and chasing down the occasional corrupt Knight.</i></p><p>A tightness in my stomach made me aware of how hungry I was, and I realized Brasti wasn&#x2019;t the only one ready for a hearty breakfast. <i>Food</i>, I thought, <i>then figure out how to save the world</i>. I was glad I wouldn&#x2019;t have to do it while the villagers&#x2019; screaming brats ran around</p><p>wanting to play at being Greatcoats with us, demanding our swords and trying our patience.</p><p>Which was odd. Why didn&#x2019;t the villagers bring their children? There wasn&#x2019;t much danger to the village&#x2014;the Tailor had sent out scouts and none had reported sighting anything more than a few handfuls of Trin&#x2019;s men&#x2014;not enough to cause us grief. Come to think of it, where were the rest of Trin&#x2019;s men? They might have been on missions, but surely they&#x2019;d have been recalled as soon as anyone knew we were here. And the children . . .</p><p>&#x201c;Swords!&#x201d; I shouted.</p><p>Well, &#x201c;shouted&#x201d; is a bit optimistic, given my tongue was still thick in my throat, and I could barely move my lips.

The one who saved his life?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You might be right,&#x201d; Brasti said, awkwardly brushing a hand across my head. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, Falcio.

The floor was dusty. The wall against his back was solid stone.<br> <br>He was wearing jeans and a long-sleeved T-shirt, but no shoes.<br> <br>His head was sore. He touched it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. only to pull his hand away in shock.<br> <br>His hair had been shaved off&#x2014;<br> <br>With a piercing shriek, the rusty iron door of his cell swung open and light flooded in.<br> <br>A horrifying silhouette filled the doorway.<br> <br>The outline of a bull-headed man.<br> <br>A minotaur.<br> <br>Or at least a man wearing a bull-shaped helmet.<br> <br>He was well muscled, with knotty biceps and a stocky chest. While his upper body&#x2014;save for the bull mask&#x2014;was bare, on his lower half he wore modern black army-issue cargo pants and black combat boots.<br> <br>I must be dreaming, Jack thought.<br> <br>He didn&#x2019;t have time for a second thought because right then, with a roar, the &#x201c;minotaur&#x201d; charged at him.<br> <br>A serrated hunting knife appeared in the masked man&#x2019;s right hand and it came slashing down at Jack.<br> <br>Instinct kicked in.<br> <br>Half rising, Jack grabbed the minotaur&#x2019;s knife-hand, twisted it and threw the man to the side, springing to his own feet as he did so.<br> <br>The minotaur tackled him, and they rolled, struggling, wrestling, ending up on the ground with the masked man on top, straddling Jack and pressing down with the knife.<br> <br>Clenching his teeth and using all his strength, Jack gripped the hilt of the knife, keeping its blade at bay, two inches from his own throat.<br> <br>The blade edged closer to his Adam&#x2019;s apple, and in a faraway corner of his brain, Jack recalled that if you died in a dream, you woke up. He wondered if that would happen here.<br> <br>Only what if it&#x2019;s not a dream, Jack&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?<br> <br>His opponent pushed harder and from behind the black bull mask, Jack heard the man inside grunting with exertion.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s just a man! his mind screamed. It&#x2019;s just a man!<br> <br>And every man can be beaten.<br> <br>Energized, Jack shifted his weight and reverse-rolled, sending the minotaur smashing headfirst into the stone wall.<br> <br>It was a sickening blow. A dull crack echoed out&#x2014;the sound of the minotaur&#x2019;s neck breaking&#x2014;and the masked man slumped to the dusty floor and lay still.<br> <br>Jack heaved for breath.<br> <br>What a way to wake up.<br> <br>Regaining his composure a little, he took in his cell for the first time.<br> <br>The door was still open a little, letting in light. The cell looked exceedingly old: the walls were made of sandstone; the heavy rusted door sat on ancient iron hinges. As for what lay beyond the open doorway, God only knew.<br> <br>On one wall of Jack&#x2019;s cell were two images carved deep into the stone:<br> <br><br> <br>The first one Jack knew: it was the ancient Egyptian hieroglyph ankh, meaning &#x201c;life.&#x201d;<br> <br>As for the second symbol, it looked like a swirling four-armed octopus. It was a variant of a rare and ancient symbol found in Hindu, Buddhist, and Neolithic cultures called a tetragammadion.<br> <br>As he looked at it, Jack had the distinct feeling he had seen this symbol only recently, but he couldn&#x2019;t recall where.<br> <br>He blinked, trying to remember. But it was no use. His mind was still too groggy.<br> <br>Instead he tried to recall the last place he had been before he had lost consciousness and woken up here.<br> <br>Pine Gap, he thought.<br> <br>The top-secret base deep in the Australian desert.<br> <br>He&#x2019;d gone there to attend a meeting, a high-level meeting.<br> <br>Something about the SKA Array&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>He remembered arriving at the base outside the remote town of Alice Springs with Lily, Alby, and the dogs, and being allowed inside by the armed gate-guards.<br> <br>And he recalled being met outside the observatory lab at Pine Gap by the tall, bespectacled figure of General Eric Abrahamson, the genial yet whip-smart man who had replaced Jack&#x2019;s longtime boss and friend, General Peter Cosgrove, after Cosgrove had been promoted to higher office.<br> <br>They&#x2019;d shaken hands and Abrahamson had introduced Jack to his soon-to-be replacement, a stern-faced general named Conor Beard. With his angular features and neatly trimmed red beard, Beard&#x2019;s operational call sign had been a slam dunk: since his early days in the military, he&#x2019;d been known as Redbeard.<br> <br>&#x201c;Glad you dressed up for the occasion, Jack,&#x201d; Abrahamson had said wryly.<br> <br>Jack had been dressed casually, wearing jeans, sneakers, and a blue shirt over an old white T-shirt. He wore a brown suede glove over his titanium left hand and a simple Casio G-Shock watch on his right wrist.<br> <br>He&#x2019;d smiled back at Abrahamson in the desert sun. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t work for you anymore, so I get to dress any way I like.&#x201d;<br> <br>After exchanging greetings with Lily and Alby, Abrahamson bent down to pet the dogs. &#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t seen these two since they were pups.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack said, &#x201c;They own me now. Everyone owns me now. Zoe. Lily. The dogs. I was once the fifth greatest warrior, you know.&#x201d;<br> <br>Abrahamson laughed. &#x201c;What about Horus? What does she think of the dogs?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack whistled sharply and a moment later, his loyal peregrine falcon, Horus, previously soaring overhead, had landed lightly on his shoulder. Looped around her neck was a leather collar from which hung a GoPro camera. She glared at Abrahamson and Beard, as if peering into their souls.<br> <br>&#x201c;She tolerates them,&#x201d; Jack said as Horus took to the air again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come inside.&#x201d; Abrahamson guided them through the doors of the lab. &#x201c;I have something important to show you.&#x201d;<br> <br>And then nothing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. nothing till he woke up here with a man dressed as a bull trying to kill him.</p><h2>Norman Rockwell, Artist and Illustrator</h2><p>More than six hundred of Rockwell&#39;s paintings and illustrations are reproduced in an exposition of the beloved American painter&#39;s career</p><p></p><h2>Shadow Spinner</h2><p>When Shahrazad, the Arabian Nights heroine, begins running out of stories, Marjan, a crippled serving girl, provides her with a new but incomplete tale, for which she must face dangerous trials in order to learn the ending.

With her crippled foot, Marjan never expects to be dragged off to the palace, but that is what happens after a chance meeting with Shahrazadthe storyteller who wins her life each night with cliffhanging stories for the sultan, and who obtains a story from Marjan. Heartbroken at leaving her Aunt Chava and her Uncle Eli, Marjan confronts cruelty within the palace's lush interior, where wives and concubines can be executed at the sultan's whim, and where the Khatun, the sultan's mother, spies on everyone. Dispatched by Shahrazad to find more stories, Marjan sneaks out into the marketplace, where she eventually finds an old storyteller who tells her the end of a story of which the sultan has become fond. Beaten and imprisoned by the Khatun, Marjan escapes the palace, only to return and tell the sultan an allegory that enables him to realize his love for Shahrazad, and to spare her life. Despite the licenses Fletcher takes with the story of Shahrazad, the novel may entice readers into the pages of Richard Burton's far richer work; they will appreciate the power of storytellingthat it may expand the soul of even the most hardened listener.

Focusing on six key artists?Robert Johnson, Harmonica Frank, Randy Newman, the Band, Sly Stone, and Elvis Presley?Marcus explores the evolution and impact of rock ?n? roll and its unique place in American culture.

Marcus puts his subjects--which include Robert Johnson, Elvis Presley, The Band, Randy Newman, and Sly Stone--into their proper context, which is the culture-at-large. He makes you understand why these musicians <i>matter</i>, and what they've contributed to the American imagination. In his introduction, Marcus confesses that he's no longer "capable of mulling over Elvis without thinking about Herman Melville"--to the benefit, I might add, of both parties.Greil Marcus was one of the original staffers at<i> Rolling Stone</i>.

Although the book opens with a scary scene--a family is stabbed to death by "a man named Jack&#x201d; --the story quickly moves into more child-friendly storytelling. The sole survivor of the attack--an 18-month-old baby--escapes his crib and his house, and toddles to a nearby graveyard. Quickly recognizing that the baby is orphaned, the graveyard's ghostly residents adopt him, name him Nobody ("Bod"), and allow him to live in their tomb. Taking inspiration from Kipling&#x2019;s <i>The Jungle Book</i>, Gaiman describes how the toddler navigates among the headstones, asking a lot of questions and picking up the tricks of the living and the dead. In serial-like episodes, the story follows Bod's progress as he grows from baby to teen, learning life&#x2019;s lessons amid a cadre of the long-dead, ghouls, witches, intermittent human interlopers. A pallid, nocturnal guardian named Silas ensures that Bod receives food, books, and anything else he might need from the human world. Whenever the boy strays from his usual play among the headstones, he finds new dangers, learns his limitations and strengths, and acquires the skills he needs to survive within the confines of the graveyard and in wider world beyond.

The whole makes a Tolstoy-scale epic of Soviet life, from the idealism of youth, through the confronting of reality, to a beaten disillusion. This last volume covers the bloody decade from Stalin&#39;s Terror to the turning point of World War II in 1943. Against this depressing backdrop, however, Rybakov creates romantic tension and suspense, as the reader roots for the coming together again of Sasha, the protagonist of the earlier volumes, and his still beloved Varya.

Because of its unique meaning and the intense emotions it invokes, Holy Week brings high expectations on the part of congregations and places unusual demands on those who deliver the messages. It takes a specially gifted preacher to communicate the profundity of Christs Passion and its supreme relevance for our contemporary world. Fleming Rutledge is just such a preacher. Heralded by congregations and peers alike as one of todays most compelling and powerful Christian voices, Mrs. Rutledge is also a best-selling author whose previous collections of sermons have touched readers deeply. This new volume, representing twenty-five years of Holy Week and Easter preaching, offers a wide-ranging vision of the Cross and Resurrection that will inform and inspire committed believers and serious seekers alike. Divided into seven sections that progress through Holy Week from Palm Sunday to Good Friday to Easter and on through Eastertide, these sermons incorporate the biblical themes of sacrifice for sin, vicarious suffering, victory over evil and death, and the new creation arising out of eternal love. Many of these sermons are brand-new; others - especially those for Good Friday - have been rethought and reworked over a period of years. None have ever been published before. All of them consistently display Mrs. Rutledges startling ability to bridge the message of the ancient biblical texts with the distinct needs of modern people. Intellectually engaging, pastorally wise, and beautifully written, The Undoing of Death is accented with thirty-three artistic masterpieces depicting the events of Holy Week, making it a feast for the eye as well as the soul.</p><p>Fleming Rutledge is an Episcopal priest now engaged in a nationwide ministry of preaching and teaching. Her best-selling books have been widely acclaimed across denominational boundaries and have established her reputation as one of America&#39;s finest preachers.<b>Publishers Weekly &#x2014; starred review</b><br> "This outstanding sermon collection by Rutledge reflects 26 years of preaching during Holy Week and Easter... Although fellow preachers will pore over her words to gather ideas for their own homilies, the general reader will also profit from these sermons, which are full of anecdotes and powerful insights into biblical passages."<br><br><b>Church Times (UK)</b><br> "Here are homilies from the heart, relating the gospel of Christ crucified and risen to our contemporary dilemmas as well as to our aboriginal sins and sorrows. . . This is a beautifully produced volume, a pleasure to handle. Reproductions of paintings of the Passion and the resurrection provide an effective visual commentary on the sermons."<br><br><b>M. Craig Barnes, pastor of The National Presbyterian Church</b><br> "Fleming Rutledge has an amazing knack for finding your most cherished doubts about the Christian faith. She then lets the gospel encounter these doubts by unveiling your most cherished hopes. By that point in her sermons you realize that you are listening to the Risen Lord and not just the preacher. "<br><br><b>The Rev. Carol Anderson, All Saints Church, Beverly Hills, California</b><br> "Fleming Rutledge's sermons are thoughtful, compelling, biblical, and personal &#x2014; a welcome combination for the church today. The power of the Word preached with intelligent warmth is all too rare in the pulpit, but it is so very evident in&nbsp;<i>The Undoing of Death.</i>"<br><br><b>Donald Armstrong, Grace Episcopal Church, Colorado Springs</b><br> "Good Friday and Easter Day attendance has risen to over 3,000 in our parish as Fleming Rutledge has returned over the years to confront our congregation with the news of Christ crucified and raised. The power of God in her words works to raise us from the tomb of our modern anxieties and predispositions to that promised abundant and everlasting life. These sermons are not sentimental escapist fare that ignore or sidestep the theological reality of our situation. These are, rather, sin-confronting, repentance-inducing, hope-infusing antidotes to our desperate prognosis. This book will restore passion and urgency in the preacher and offer an insightful application of salvation to daily living for all."<br><br><b>Frederick H. Borsch, Episcopal Bishop of Los Angeles</b><br> "These are passionate sermons. They speak arrestingly and thoughtfully of the passion of Jesus and of the passionate love of God. They tell us how and why the power of that crucified love intervenes in contemporary lives and how, in Fleming Rutledge's phrasing, 'the cross is backlit by the dawn of God's new day."<br><br><b>Martha J. Horne, Virginia Theological Seminary</b><br> "Fleming Rutledge is a powerful and provocative preacher. Proudly evangelical in her proclamation of the gospel, she provides a penetrating analysis of the human condition and a clear affirmation of God's gracious response. Along the way, she invites poets, sages, and rogues to enter the conversation, joining their voices with those of our spiritual ancestors."<br><br><b>Samuel T. Lloyd III, dean of Washington National Cathedral</b><br> "Christianity hangs or falls on the Cross. And yet, preaching for Holy Week and Easter is notoriously difficult. How to take the full measure of our human lostness? How to find words for what God has done on Calvary? How to speak credibly of an empty tomb? Here is passionate, unstinting, full-blooded preaching on the deepest mysteries of Christian faith. Fleming Rutledge doesn't hold back. She brings her formidable intellect and her wide reading to bear in saying what is nearly unsayable: that God has overcome the world's darkness, and what happened on a hill outside Jerusalem has made all the difference."<br><br><b>Leanne Van Dyk, Western Theological Seminary</b><br> "Excellent, honest, and compelling sermons are a rare and splendid treasure for the church. Here is a book full of them. Fleming Rutledge's sermons and meditations on Holy Week and Easter go to the very heart of the Christian faith. They portray the drama of the gospel &#x2014; both the darkness of the cross and the burst of Easter light. They then call believers to a life that takes up that cross and rejoices in that light."</p><h2>The Herbal Body Book: A Natural Approach to Healthier Hair, Skin, and Nails</h2><p>This is the book that began Storey&#39;s best-selling series!

His previous work includes a pentalogy of thrillers set during the Cold War, beginning with <em>The Bridge of Sighs</em> and concluding with <em>Victory Square</em>.</b></p> <p>How do you bring a character created in 1953 into the modern world without disappointing that character&#x2019;s millions of followers in the process? This was the challenge faced by Jeffery Deaver when Ian Fleming Publications handed him the responsibility of writing the next official James Bond novel, <em>Carte Blanche</em>. I don&#x2019;t know how I would have done it, but I do know one thing&#x2014;Deaver, a specialist in the art of crafting nail-biting suspense, has done it better than I ever could have.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s a tightrope walk, balancing the tradition with the requirements of contemporary life, and Deaver handles it with panache. Beautiful women with unlikely but mesmerizing names? Check. (See Ophelia Maidenstone and Felicity Willing.) A top-drawer set of wheels with occasional soliloquies to its grace and power? Check. (The Bentley Continental GT coup�, in this case.) M, Moneypenny, Mary Goodnight, Bill Tanner, Felix Leiter? Check on all counts. A drink on hand that requires extra care from a bartender, but has yet to be named? Check. License to kill? Check, but under a different name: carte blanche.</p> <p>How about the subtly and unsubtly perverse villains? Naturally, and they come in two sharply defined forms: Niall Dunne, "The Irishman," a brilliant tactician who brings to mind <em>From Russia With Love</em>&#x2019;s Kronsteen, and his boss, Severan Hydt, the head of a global refuse-collection empire, whose love of decay in all its forms borders on necrophilia. Time spent with Hydt will make you long for a shower.</p> <p>But what the Fleming aficionado will inevitably notice here are the differences, which turn this latest escapade into what feels, and should feel, like one of those things that are very popular these days: a reboot.</p> <p>James Bond, a veteran of Afghanistan, is an ex-smoker. Despite run-ins with an MI5 twit named Percy Osborne-Smith, this Bond is more of a team player than I remember him ever being. But where one really notices the encroachment of the contemporary world is in his relations with women. James Bond has become . . . <em>sensitive</em>?</p> <p>Actually, yes, but never to the point of priggishness. The hard Bond remains, but it&#x2019;s a different world than it was in 1953, and the women in <em>Carte Blanche</em>&#x2014;the Bond girls, if you will&#x2014;are of equal measure to the men. Ophelia Maidenstone, a coworker at ODG (Overseas Development Group, tenuously connected to MI6), besides being ravishingly beautiful, is indispensible&#x2014;without her, Bond would be dead in the water. And when romance begins to bloom between them we find that, even after he&#x2019;s left town, she remains, haunting his thoughts so much that after a night with another woman Bond feels, of all unlikely things, guilt.</p> <p>If this seems very un-Bond, it is, but it&#x2019;s a testament to Deaver&#x2019;s strength as a storyteller that the reader so easily accepts that this is Fleming&#x2019;s world 2.0, and it&#x2019;s just as dangerous and exciting as it was when Le Chiffre glared from across a card table.</p> <p>Don&#x2019;t run from this new world, aficionado, for you&#x2019;ll be rewarded. Not only with a gripping installment, but with a fascinating subplot concerning Bond&#x2019;s parents, one that not only piques the reader&#x2019;s interest but, by the end of the novel, begs for a continuation in the next Bond adventure. This new Bond may be a modern man, but his roots are deep in the past, and if <em>Carte Blanche</em> is any indication, the past will soon catch up with him. I, for one, will gladly be on hand to witness that confrontation.</p> <p></p> <br> <br>Jeffery Deaver&nbsp;is the #1 international bestselling author of more than forty novels, three collections of short stories, and a nonfiction law book.

Like Hemingway himself, Nick is the son of a doctor (&#34;The Indian Camp&#34;; &#34;The Doctor and the Doctor&#39;s Wife&#34;); he relishes fishing and hunting in the northern peninsula of Michigan (&#34;Big Two-Hearted River&#34;). He romances a young girl named Marjorie, a summer waitress at a summer resort (&#34;The End of Something&#34;; &#34;The Three-Day Blow&#34;). He goes abroad during World War I and serves as an American Red Cross ambulance driver; he also is a courier, carrying chocolates and cigarettes to Italian soldiers on the Austro-Italian battlefront. And, like Hemingway, Nick suffers a knee wound (&#34;In Another Country&#34;). Unlike Hemingway, however, Nick suffered post-traumatic shock; his mind periodically seems to come unhinged (&#34;A Way You&#39;ll Never Be&#34;). In all, Hemingway wrote at least a dozen stories that center around Nick Adams, and in 1972, Scribner&#39;s published a volume entitled The Nick Adams Stories.</p><p></p><h2>Pierced: A Novel (2) (Henning Juul)</h2><p><b>The acclaimed author of <i>Burned</i> is back with more heart-stopping suspense in a gritty and thrilling sequel that pits Norwegian crime reporter Henning Juul against an international crime ring.</b><br><br><b>From the internationally bestselling author of <i>Burned </i>(&#x201c;Possibly the best $15 you&#x2019;ll spend on a mystery this year.&#x201d; <i>&#x2014;Bookpage</i>) comes a taut and riveting tale of secrets, betrayals, and a dangerous quest for the truth. </b><br><br><i>If you find out who set me up, I&#x2019;ll tell you what happened the day your son died. </i>That is the message crime reporter Henning Juul&#x2014;back at work after being terribly burned and scarred for life in a fire that killed his son&#x2014;receives from a jailed extortionist named Tore Pulli who&#x2019;s been convicted for a murder he claims he didn&#x2019;t commit. <br><br>Truth has never meant more for Henning Juul.

He knows the murders Pulli was convicted of do not bear his signature, and he&#x2019;s convinced that Pulli would never have taken his own life. Striking up a fragile partnership with Iver Gundersen, a journalist now living with Juul&#x2019;s ex-wife, Juul uncovers an internal power struggle in the gang world, where the desire for serious money is destroying the traditional, honor-based hierarchy. Uncovering more questions than answers, Henning soon realizes that he has to find not one but several killers . . . ruthless murderers who have never been more dangerous than they are now.</p><p>Thomas Enger is a former journalist.

The sheet under him is wet and the air quivers with heat. He runs clammy fingers over the scars on his neck and face. His head is pounding with a bass rhythm that is pouring out from an open window in Steenstrupsgate. In the distance a motorbike roars as it sets off, then there is silence. Like the drumroll before an execution.<br> <br>Henning takes a deep breath and tries to strangle the dream that still feels all too real, but it refuses to go away.<br> <br>It had started off as a good dream. They had gone outside to play, Jonas and him. A thick layer of snow had covered the ground overnight. At the junction by Birkelunden Park the tramlines were reduced to just ruler-straight silver lines, and they could barely make them out. The dense snowflakes were still dancing in the air, but they melted the moment they landed on Henning&#x2019;s cheek.<br> <br>He was pulling Jonas on the sled down Toftesgate and into Sofienberg Park, where the children looked like ants on the small hill sloping down from the church. Jonas threw himself energetically from side to side. Henning was exhausted when they finally reached the top of the hill. He was about to sit down at the rear of the sled when Jonas stopped him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not you, Daddy! Only me!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay. But you know that means you&#x2019;ll have to pull the sled back up the hill all on your own.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, yeah.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you promise?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeeees!&#x201d;<br> <br>Henning knew that the wet snowflakes had a longer life span than the promise Jonas had just made, but he didn&#x2019;t mind.<br> <br>&#x201c;Give me a push, I want to go reeeeally fast!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay. Hold on tight. Let&#x2019;s count to three.&#x201d;<br> <br>They counted in unison:<br> <br>&#x201c;ONE! TWO! Aaaand THREEEE!!!&#x201d;<br> <br>And Henning gave Jonas a big push. He heard the boy squeal with delight as he got under way and noticed that the other children were watching him, too, enjoying the sight of the little boy with the pale blue woolly hat hurtling toward a jump that someone had built halfway down the hill. And Jonas reached it, gained some height, but landed quickly and whooped as he turned the steering wheel to avoid colliding with a girl coming from the side. She turned around and followed Jonas with her eyes as he veered further and further to the left.<br> <br>Toward the tree.<br> <br>Henning saw it, too, saw where Jonas was heading, his small fists gripping the steering wheel. Henning started running down the hill, but he lost his footing. He stumbled and rolled over a couple of times before he managed to get back on his feet.<br> <br>The snowflakes, the voices, and the din faded into the background as Henning mouthed a scream, but no sound came out. He looked in desperation as the other parents who were also watching Jonas stayed rooted to the spot and did nothing to help him. In the end he closed his eyes. He didn&#x2019;t want to see it when it happened. He didn&#x2019;t want to see his son die. Not again.<br> <br>And Jonas was gone. As were the hill and the snowflakes, the trees and the people. It grew dark all around him. The unmistakable smell of smoke stung his nose. And even though he couldn&#x2019;t see Jonas, he had no trouble hearing his cries. Henning waved his arms frantically to carve a hole in the darkness surging in front of him, but it made no difference. The intense heat scorched his face. Breathing became difficult and he started to cough.<br> <br>A glimpse of light appeared in the smoke. Henning blinked and focused on the opening that grew ever larger; he could see a door being eaten up by the flames. He coughed again. Then the gap started to close up and soon the smoke covered it completely. It was burning hot and black as night everywhere. And then Jonas started to scream.<br> <br>Again.<br><br>Henning exhales at the sight of the flashing red light. His eyes seek out the other smoke alarm in the ceiling. He waits for it to emit its cyclical indicator of rude health. But the seconds pass. And some more. And even more. He feels a tightness creep across his chest and spread out to his shoulders and neck. At last the second smoke alarm lights up. A quick red flash.<br> <br>He flops back onto his pillow and breathes out while he waits for the monster in his chest to calm down. Eventually it resumes its normal pace. He touches the scars on his face again. They still hurt. Not just on the outside. And he knows they will keep hurting until he finds out who torched his flat. Who snuffed out the life of the best little boy in the whole world.<br> <br>Henning turns to the clock on the bedside table. It&#x2019;s not even ten thirty in the evening. The headache that made him lie down an hour and a half ago is still throbbing. He massages his temples as he shuffles to the kitchen and takes the last can of Coke from the fridge. Back in the living room he tidies away clothes and newspapers from the sofa before he sits down and opens the can. The sound of bubbles rising to the surface makes him sleepy. He closes his eyes and longs for a dream without snowflakes.</p><h2>Old Testament Student manual, genesis - 2 Samuel</h2><p>Includes commentary, historical and cultural insights, maps, and charts relating to the Old Testament.</p><p></p><h2>Groucho Marx and the Broadway Murders: A Mystery Featuring Groucho Marx</h2><p>In Ron Goulart's well received series featuring comedian-cum-amateur sleuth Groucho Marx, Groucho and his writer Frank Denby have made a name for themselves as detectives. In fact, in their last case, they were able to outsmart Sherlock Holmes, or at least the actor playing him. However, both men play down their sleuthing abilities and to escape their new reputation, Groucho agrees to perform in a Broadway play and Frank accompanies his wife on a business trip. When Groucho learns that Frank and Jane are going to New York via train he decides to join them, figuring it will be a nice relaxing journey.<br><br>However, murder and mayhem somehow follow them across the country. First, before even leaving for New York they are approached by a local mobster who firmly believes that the recent murder of his associate was not a mob hit. He asks them to look into the matter and Groucho suggests that he try "Philip Marlowe, Dan Turner or some other Hollywood shamus" even though "they don't have our track record...or a strawberry birthmark right here." From there, things only get more interesting. On the train they meet Dian Bowers, the newest star of Daniel Manheim, a domineering Hollywood producer. A series of bizarre events unfolds on the train, including an attempt on Manheim's life. When they arrive in New York, Groucho agrees to escort Dian to the premiere of her estranged husband's play, but the play never makes it into the second act because a body is discovered on stage. When Dian's husband becomes the prime suspect, Groucho and Frank once again find themselves playing detective. <br><br>Searching for clues in the Big Apple and trying to see if the second murder is at all connected to the death of the mobster, Groucho and Frank have their hands full. However, the pressure doesn't get to Groucho and as he hunts for clues he still has time for all of his silly gags and terrible puns. Whether or not you are a Groucho fan, "this enjoyable little tale will charm the baggy pants off you." <br></p><p>Ron Goulart, twice nominated for an Edgar Award, has published a number of mysteries and several nonfiction books dealing with the world of the comic strip. He lives in Ridgefield, Connecticut and is currently at work on the fifth book in the series.Groucho Marx and the Broadway Murders<br>OneGroucho Marx solved his first Manhattan murder case in the summer of 1939.For good measure, again with me as his Watson, he also managed to solve a killing that had taken place in Hollywood. That we did from a distance of some three thousand miles.I'm Frank Denby. I used to be a crime reporter with the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>. Two years before, while I was scripting Groucho's weekly radio show, he and I became a detective team for the first time and came up with the solution to a murder. Since then we'd worked successfully on several other cases. "We're as good as the Thin Man, Philo Vance, and Charlie Chan rolled into one," Groucho maintained. "Although why anybody would want a five-hundred-pound detective is beyond me."After our radio show was cancelled, Groucho and I collaborated on a screwball comedy movie script we called <i>Cinderella on Wheels</i>. That had been optioned by Mammoth Pictures and was presently languishing on the shelf. But on the strength of that sale, I managed to get myself hired for six months as a staff writer at Mammoth. Working in an impressively small office in the Writers' Building, I initially turned out a revise on the script for <i>Curse of the Zombies</i> and then did the second draft of <i>The Zombies Walk Again</i>. "That's not a catchy enough title for upper-crust patrons such as myself," Groucho had observed on hearingit. "Nobody <i>walks</i> in Beverly Hills. You'd best rechristen it <i>The Zombies Ride Again, Preferably in a Rolls-Royce."</i>I next wrote the first two drafts on <i>Stop the Presses,</i> a B movie that Mammoth was trying to get either Chester Morris or Lee Tracy--whoever'd work more cheaply--to star in. Hollywood being Hollywood, none of these movies was a comedy. My contract hadn't been picked up and by early summer I was once again at liberty. But I was in no danger of starving.My wife, Jane, is the best-looking cartoonist in America and her comic strip, <i>Hollywood Molly</i>, was by then the third most popular in the country. As a result, a large New York advertising agency and the Amalgamated Radio Network wanted to talk to her about turning <i>Molly</i> into a weekly radio show. When they suggested that Jane come back to Manhattan to discuss the idea and the possibility of writing the scripts herself, she told them she wouldn't be interested at all unless she could collaborate with her gifted author husband. So we'd both been invited eastward.Admittedly I was moderately depressed by the fact that I had--temporarily I hoped--ceased to contribute to the family income. And I wasn't any too cheered by the way things in general were going with the world. Franco's gang had won the civil war in Spain, adding another fascist dictator to the list. Hitler was continuing to take over more and more of Europe and both England and France seemed on the brink of declaring war on Germany. President Roosevelt was still talking about keeping America out of World War II, but I figured we were going to get into it fairly soon.Two days before we were booked to leave on the Super Chief streamliner out of the brand-new Union Station, I decided to stop in at Groucho's Sunset Strip office to tell him that we'd be out of town for a couple of weeks.It was a clear, blue afternoon and the traffic flashing by on Sunset was the usual mix of foreign sports cars, limousines, and jalopies. As I walked toward the building in which Groucho rented office space, I passed threeseparate young women who bore an uncanny resemblance to the late Jean Harlow. The building itself resembled a Poverty Row set designer's idea of a Southern mansion.I was halfway up the wooden stairs that led to the second floor when I heard a loud rattling thump from the vicinity of Groucho's outer office.Double-timing, I hurried up to the door and yanked it open.Nan Somerville, his secretary, was sprawled on the floor next to her desk. She was just starting to sit up, muttering. Half of a torn theatrical poster was clutched in her right hand. "Hi, Frank," she said. "Never stand on a swivel chair when you're ripping the poster of a no-good magician off your office wall."Leaning over, I took hold of her free hand and helped her to rise. "Sound advice," I said. "In fact, wasn't that something Benjamin Franklin included in <i>Poor Richard's Almanac</i>?""Quite probably, although every time I ran into Ben Franklin all he ever told me was to go fly a kite.""Sounds like you're coming down with Grouchoitis.""God, I hope not. Did that really sound like a line he'd say?""Or already said.""Oy."Nan was a feisty, muscular lady in her late thirties and her earlier career as a circus acrobat and then a stuntwoman at MGM convinced Groucho she would be ideally suited to work as his secretary. She was a crackerjack typist, too.Glancing up at the portion of the poster that was still on the wall, I inquired, "You and Young Houdini have broken up?"She crumpled up her portion of the poster and tossed it into the deskside wastebasket. "I should've known any guy of forty-six who calls himself Young anything was going to be untrustworthy.""So what precipitated the breakup?" I looked at the closed door of Groucho's inner office."Groucho wasn't to blame for this one," she said. "Admittedly he scared the Amazing El Carim off by insisting on doing card tricks for himevery time he dropped by here to pick me up for lunch. And he alienated Yarko the Great by repeatedly warning him that I was too heavy to be used safely in his Floating Lady illusion. But he didn't screw the Young Houdini romance up."Nan, a mostly rational person otherwise, had an unfortunate affinity for falling in love only with guys who were professional magicians."What exactly happened?""Young Houdini vanished.""Magicians," I pointed out, "have a tendency to do that now and then.""True, but not with two hundred dollars of my money.""You didn't loan the guy dough?""He borrowed it," Nan corrected. "Although I didn't know that until I consulted the cookie jar in my kitchen two nights ago. The money and Young Houdini haven't been seen since."After a sympathetic nod, I asked her, "Groucho in?"Nan pointed a thumb in the direction of the Sunset Strip. "Across the street at Moonbaum's deli," she said. "How's Jane?""You may find this hard to believe, but she's doing better than I am."Nan sat down in the swivel chair and rested her elbows on her desk. "You still don't like the idea that she makes enough money to support you if need be, do you?""I can live with it, but--""Jane's not the usual wife, so you're really going to have to get used to that fact.""I suppose so, yeah," I said. "She and I are going to be heading back East in a couple of days and I dropped in to say farewell to Groucho.""Vacation? Second honeymoon?""Nope, mostly business." And I explained about the radio show deal."Gee, that's swell," said Nan when I finished. "It'll be, I bet, more fun collaborating with your wife than with Groucho.""I'm undecided about that," I told her, moving to the door. "I've become used to cigar smoke.""Have a safe trip," said Nan."B movies to the contrary," I assured her, "nothing very exciting or dangerous ever happens on a train trip east."At the time I actually believed that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>There was a chunky forty-year-old newsboy in a Hawaiian shirt hawking papers out in front of the deli. "Extra! Extra!" he was shouting. "Mobster killed in gangland slaying!"The gangster in question was a local gambler named Nick Sanantonio. I hadn't the faintest suspicion that his violent death had a damn thing to do with me.I found Groucho in his favorite booth, looking forlornly from his blintzes to a thick manuscript opened beside his plate. "I've been blintzkrieged," he complained as I slid in opposite him. "Mellman the waiter persuaded me to peruse his latest play.""This isn't still <i>The Rape of the Lox,</i> is it?""Nay, this is a new effort of his." Groucho gave a negative shake of his head. "I entered these sacred confines simply to indulge in a helping of cheese blintzes and a celery tonic and then Mellman descended on me like a snappy simile I'll think of before we go to press. He pleaded with me to read this new effort, which is entitled something like <i>Shootout at Kosher Canyon</i> or <i>Goodbye, Mr. Knish</i> or--""No, Groucho, it's called <i>Love Laughs at Lox Myths,</i>" corrected the lean, frail Mellman, who'd been lurking nearby."Begone," suggested Groucho, making a shooing motion. "My disciple and I have some parables to whip into shape. Then, if we have time, I want to revise my Sermon on the Mount and put in some more socko one-liners. We're also thinking of picking a new location for that--how's the Sermon at Malibu strike you?""I'll bring you some more coffee." The waiter went flat-footing away.I leaned an elbow on the tabletop and said, "The reason I dropped by, Groucho, was--""You haven't even asked me, Rollo, why I have such a woebegone expression on my puss.""I mistook it for your everyday look. Sorry.""The reason is that I saw the final cut of <i>At the Circus</i> yesterday.""And?""Chico, Harpo, and I have pretty much decided to change our name to the Andrews Sisters and try starting all over again."The Marx Brothers had just recently finished filming a new movie for MGM. It was part of a three-picture deal for which they were being handsomely paid. I mentioned that to Groucho."Actually, my lad, the salary goes beyond handsomely and into gorgeously," he corrected. "When you realize that three overgrown street urchins are pulling down such dough, why, it makes you proud to be an American. If only <i>At the Circus</i> wasn't so out and out lousy, I'm sure we'd all be as happy as kings. The kings I have in mind are, reading from left to right, King Lear, Wayne King, and King of the Royal Mounted." He paused to fish a cigar out of the pocket of his corn-colored sports coat. "Now, many of our critics think we'll go from bad to worse with these three movies. But we've outwitted them by making the worst one first. So what we'll be doing is going from worse to bad.""I thought you were pleased to be back at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.""In your vanished youth did you see a film entitled <i>Frankenstein</i>?""Sure, but--""How about a cinematic effort called <i>The Mummy</i>?""Yeah.""What do those two movies have in common?""Boris Karloff?""No, Rollo. The monsters in both were based on Louis B. Mayer," he said, putting the dead cigar between his teeth. "And Mayer is still roaming the grounds at MGM. At night the peasants claim they can hear him howling at the moon, pinching starlets, and dropping options.""Can I mention now why I--""Here's something else to think about on those sleepless nights at the front," he continued. "On its roster of stars MGM has such beauties as Greta Garbo, Hedy Lamarr, Myrna Loy, Jeanette MacDonald, and Eleanor Powell. But who was cast as the young thing I make a pass at?""Wasn't Eve Arden in that movie with you?""Exactly." He dropped the unlit cigar away in his coat pocket and returned his attention to his blintzes. "But enough evasion, old chap. Tell me why you intruded on my humble repast?""Jane and I are leaving for New York this Thursday and--""I forgot to mention that there are actually two highly passable moments in <i>At the Circus</i>." He ate the final bite. "Modesty prevents me from saying that I'm responsible for both. However, since you're obviously about to plead and cajole, I'll reveal that one occurs when I appear in acrobatic tights. It is, I guarantee, a sight for sore eyes. In fact, several oculists have booked blocks of seats for their patients at the first sneak preview. The other great moment occurs when I render"Lydia the Tattooed Lady" in my boyish tenor. Speaking of boyish tenors, Kenny Baker has a small part in our epic and is a slight improvement over Allan Jones. The fellow was constantly dogging my footsteps asking for singing advice and the secrets of my--""The reason that Jane and I are going to Manhattan is because they want to turn <i>Hollywood Molly</i> into a radio show.""Would you like me to sing a bit of 'Lydia the Tattooed Lady'?""No.""I take that as a negative response, meaning you don't wish to enjoy an experience that's been compared with seeing Caruso in his prime? Of course, seeing Caruso in his underwear was an equally fascinating experience and I consider myself fortunate to have witnessed--""You sang the entire song for me the last time we had lunch," I reminded him."Great songs bear repeating. I wager you've heard 'The Star Spangled Banner' more than once.""The what?"Mellman returned and put a fresh cup of coffee before Groucho. "We're all out of hemlock," he said and went away.Groucho located his cigar again, lit it, and leaned back in the booth. "Are you kiddies flying to New York, Rollo?""Nope, taking the Super Chief. Jane's uneasy about airplanes so--""A pity and a shame, young man, because I'm flying to Manhattan early next week," Groucho informed me. "We could have shared a plane and I might've obtained the services of my old chum Crash Corrigan to pilot it for us. Some folks don't like to fly with Crash, because of his unfortunate first name, but I for one--""Why are you going to New York?" I managed to ask."Not, as you might suspect, to get away from the scene of our recent crime at MGM," he assured me. "Actually, I've been invited to appear in a streamlined version of <i>The Mikado</i>. They're planning for a limited run on Broadway and possibly a series of previews at the New York World's Fair.""You're playing who?""They want me to be the Lord High Executioner. I would've preferred being the Three Little Maids from School, but this Ko-Ko part isn't bad either. Perhaps you're aware of my fondness for Gilbert and Sullivan.""I knew you were that way about Sullivan, but who's this Gilbert guy?""Not a great exit line," he observed, sliding free of the booth and heading for the cashier. "But I intend, sirrah, to utilize it as such."When we emerged onto the sunny afternoon sidewalk, two amply built dark-haired young men in wide-shouldered pinstripe suits were waiting for us.GROUCHO MARX AND THE BROADWAY MURDERS.

He shows how human culture and natural history-even the shape of cities-are rooted in this deep geological past. <br>In search of this past, Fortey takes us through the Alps, into Icelandic hot springs, down to the ocean floor, over the barren rocks of Newfoundland, into the lush ecosystems of Hawai'i, across the salt flats of Oman, and along the San Andreas Fault. On the slopes of Vesuvius, he tracks the history of the region down through the centuries?to volcanic eruptions seen by fifteenth-century Italians, the Romans, and, from striking geological evidence, even Neolithic man. As story adds to story, the recent past connects with forgotten ages long ago, then much longer ago, as he describes the movement of plates and the development of ancient continents and seas.
